# CUDA Backend Evaluation

## Scope

Use this skill for PTO CUDA backend work under `src/cuda/`, CUDA tests under
`tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py`, local A100 smoke tests, remote H200 smoke
tests through `ssh bizhaoh200`, and paper-aligned evaluation setup.

## Source Discipline

- Keep downloaded paper PDFs and extracted text under `tmp/sources/`.
- Keep source notes under `tmp/` so they are inspectable but not committed.
- Current source files:
  - `tmp/sources/arxiv-2605.03190-vdcores.pdf`
  - `tmp/sources/arxiv-2605.03190-vdcores.txt`
  - `tmp/sources/arxiv-2512.22219v1-mirage-persistent-kernel.pdf`
  - `tmp/sources/arxiv-2512.22219v1-mirage-persistent-kernel.txt`

## Local Smoke Test

Run tests through the venv Python module, not a bare `pytest`; this machine may
resolve bare `pytest` to a user-level executable outside `.venv`.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py -q
```

The current smoke test builds `cuda/host_schedule`, compiles a PTX vector-add
kernel with `nvcc`, allocates real CUDA device buffers, copies real data, runs
the kernel through the runtime C API, and validates copied-back results.

## Hardware Checks

Local A100:

```bash
command -v nvcc
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,compute_cap,driver_version,memory.total --format=csv,noheader
```

Remote H200:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'hostname; command -v nvcc || true; nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,compute_cap,driver_version,memory.total --format=csv,noheader'
```

## Paper-Aligned Evaluation Shape

Use the papers to choose workloads and baselines, but do not claim paper-level
results until full LLM serving baselines are actually run.

- VDCores setup: fixed offline decoding, 128-token context, 64 decode steps,
  batch sizes 1-8, models including Qwen3-1.7B/Qwen3-8B and Llama small
  variants, baselines including vLLM, SGLang, Mirage, ThunderKittens, and
  Torch+ThunderKittens.
- MPK setup: offline batched inference, fixed prompt length 64, decode 1024
  tokens, max batch sizes 1-16, baselines vLLM and SGLang, GPUs A100/H100/B200
  in the paper and local A100/remote H200 for this repo.
- For early PTO CUDA runtime work, report only microbenchmarks and smoke tests
  as such: launch latency, host wall time, device event time, copy bandwidth,
  and simple dependency/concurrency tests.

## Result Capture

For repeatable local/remote runs, save raw command output under
`outputs/cuda-backend/` or `tmp/cuda-backend/` with hardware, git commit, CUDA
toolkit, driver, command, and timestamp. Commit only scripts, docs, and tests;
do not commit raw benchmark outputs unless the user asks.
