# Manual Scope V0 Design

Date: 2026-04-15

Branch: `manual_scope_v0`

## Goal

Add a lighter manual-scope mode to `a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer` that:

- keeps the same submit API shape as AUTO mode
- does not introduce a separate manual submit API family
- does not support delayed dependency wiring
- publishes tasks at submit time, like AUTO mode
- allows explicit same-scope task ordering without relying entirely on
  TensorMap rediscovery

This is intentionally smaller than the previous manual-scope branch.

## Constraints

The v0 branch must follow these rules:

1. Use the same submit API as AUTO mode.
2. Append explicit dependencies into `Arg`, for example `args.add_dep(task_id)`.
3. Do not support delayed wiring and delayed linking.
4. Publish at submit time, same as AUTO mode.
5. Treat tensor allocation as a task for manual dependency building.
6. Determine whether TensorMap lookup is required from tensor scope metadata
   first, not from ring id.

## Non-goals

- no nested manual scopes in v0
- no post-submit `add_dependency(...)`
- no delayed explicit-edge replay or scope-end linking
- no batch publish barrier at manual `scope_end()`
- no attempt to redesign AUTO mode

## User-Facing API

### Scope

Manual mode remains an explicit scope:

```cpp
PTO2_SCOPE(PTO2ScopeMode::MANUAL) {
    ...
}
```

Nested manual scopes are rejected.

### Submit API

Keep the existing AUTO-mode submit entry points:

```cpp
auto out = pto2_rt_submit_aic_task(FUNC_ID, args);
auto out = pto2_rt_submit_aiv_task(FUNC_ID, args);
auto out = pto2_rt_submit_task(mixed_kernels, args);
```

No `*_manual(...)` or `*_manual_with_deps(...)` APIs in v0.

### Explicit dependencies

`Arg` grows explicit dependency support:

```cpp
Arg args;
args.add_input(...);
args.add_dep(task_id);
```

Rules:

- `Arg.add_dep(...)` is valid only inside `PTO2_SCOPE(PTO2ScopeMode::MANUAL)`
- explicit deps must point to tasks created in the current manual scope
- explicit deps are attached to the consumer before submit
- no delayed wiring after submit

### Tensor alloc

`alloc_tensors(...)` stays output-only, but returns a producer task id:

```cpp
auto alloc = alloc_tensors(create_info0, create_info1);
// alloc.task_id
// alloc.outputs
```

This allows later manual tasks to depend on the allocation task explicitly.

`alloc_tensors(...)` itself does not accept `Arg.add_dep(...)`.

## Runtime Model

### High-level behavior

Manual mode in v0 is:

- AUTO-style submit and publish
- plus explicit deps from `Arg`
- plus reduced TensorMap work for current-manual-scope-local tensors

There is no hidden manual subgraph and no delayed publish.

### Submit-time flow

Inside manual scope, submit should do this:

1. Allocate the task slot and task id.
2. Read explicit deps from `Arg`.
3. Validate that explicit deps belong to the current manual scope.
4. Turn explicit deps into ordinary fanins immediately.
5. Classify tensor args as current-manual-scope-local or boundary.
6. Skip TensorMap lookup for manual-local producer-flow tensors only when the
   explicit task ids already cover the producing tasks.
7. Keep TensorMap lookup/insert for modifier tensors (`INOUT`,
   `OUTPUT_EXISTING`) because v0 does not expose a returned task id for
   zero-output updater tasks.
8. Keep normal creator-retention and TensorMap behavior for boundary tensors.
9. Publish the task immediately, same as AUTO mode.

### Scope-end behavior

`scope_end()` should keep only normal scope-lifetime behavior.

It should not do any of the old manual-specific work:

- no deferred explicit-edge linking
- no explicit-edge replay
- no batch publish of manual tasks

## Metadata Model

Ring id is not the primary locality test in v0.

Each produced task/tensor should carry scope metadata:

- `producer_scope_depth`
- `producer_manual_scope_depth`

For v0, nested manual scopes are still rejected, but storing
`producer_manual_scope_depth` now gives a clean upgrade path later for
distinguishing outer-manual-scope tensors.

External tensors use invalid producer scope metadata.

## Tensor Lookup Rule

When a tensor is used inside manual scope:

### Manual-local tensor

Treat a tensor as manual-local only when:

- it was produced in the current manual scope
- its stored producer manual-scope depth matches the current manual-scope depth

Behavior:

- for producer-flow inputs, explicit task ids are the primary ordering source
- if the producing task is already covered by `Arg.add_dep(...)`, lookup can
  skip the manual-local creator / modifier rediscovery
- modifier tensors (`INOUT`, `OUTPUT_EXISTING`) still publish through
  TensorMap so later updates can chain correctly

### Boundary tensor

Treat everything else as boundary:

- external tensors
- tensors from AUTO scope
- tensors from outer scopes
- tensors from outer manual scopes

Behavior:

- keep creator retention
- keep normal TensorMap lookup/insert behavior unless `manual_dep=true`

This is intentionally conservative.

## `manual_dep=true`

`manual_dep=true` keeps its existing meaning:

- skip TensorMap lookup/insert for that tensor
- keep creator retention through task ownership metadata

It is orthogonal to manual scope.

## Representation Change From Previous Design

V0 intentionally narrows manual scope.

Previous heavier direction:

- submit first
- wire later
- link later
- publish later

V0:

- consumer must know explicit deps at submit time
- no post-submit dependency wiring
- no delayed linking
- no delayed publish

This means manual scope in v0 is not a general explicit-graph construction API.
It is a lighter explicit-dependency annotation on top of normal submit.

## Practical Example

```cpp
PTO2_SCOPE(PTO2ScopeMode::MANUAL) {
    Arg qk = make_qk_args(...);
    auto qk_out = pto2_rt_submit_aic_task(FUNC_QK_MATMUL, qk);

    Arg sf = make_sf_args(qk_out.outputs.tensor(0), ...);
    sf.add_dep(qk_out.task_id);
    auto sf_out = pto2_rt_submit_aiv_task(FUNC_SOFTMAX_PREPARE, sf);

    Arg pv = make_pv_args(sf_out.outputs.tensor(0), ...);
    pv.add_dep(sf_out.task_id);
    auto pv_out = pto2_rt_submit_aic_task(FUNC_PV_MATMUL, pv);

    Arg up = make_update_args(...);
    up.add_dep(sf_out.task_id);
    up.add_dep(pv_out.task_id);
    (void)pto2_rt_submit_aiv_task(FUNC_ONLINE_UPDATE, up);
}
```

This keeps the orchestration shape readable while avoiding a separate manual
submit API family.

## Important Limitation

V0 cannot express every same-scope chain only with `Arg.add_dep(...)`.

Reason:

- `alloc_tensors(...)` returns a task id because it returns materialized outputs
- normal producer tasks also expose task ids through their returned outputs
- a zero-output updater does not expose a returned task-id handle in
  `TaskOutputTensors`

Practical consequence:

- explicit deps are enough for `qk -> softmax -> pv -> update`
- they are not enough to express `update(i) -> update(i+1)` when the updater
  only modifies existing tensors
- v0 therefore keeps TensorMap publication / lookup for modifier tensors even
  inside manual scope

## Validation Plan

### Unit / behavior

- reject `Arg.add_dep(...)` outside manual scope
- reject invalid task ids in manual scope
- reject explicit deps that are not from the current manual scope
- reject nested manual scopes
- verify manual-local tensors skip TensorMap lookup when explicit deps are
  present
- verify boundary tensors still use TensorMap

### Allocation behavior

- verify `alloc_tensors(...)` returns `{task_id, outputs}`
- verify manual tasks can depend on alloc task ids

### Regression / examples

- add explicit-manual variants for the two paged-attention workloads:
  `paged_attention_manual_scope` and `paged_attention_unroll_manual_scope`
- keep the existing AUTO paths as the comparison baseline
- verify `Case1` and `Case2` against golden outputs on real hardware
- benchmark AUTO vs manual-scope with the same 30-round trimmed-average method
  used by `tools/benchmark_rounds.sh`

## Validation Status

This document reflects the cleaned `manual_scope_v0` branch state validated on
2026-04-15.

### Automated checks

- C++ UT passed:
  - `test_a2a3_pto2_manual_scope_api`
  - `test_a2a3_pto2_manual_scope_runtime`
- simulation negative test passed:
  - `tests/st/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/test_manual_scope_validation.py`
- rerun commands:
  - `ctest --test-dir tests/ut/cpp/build -R 'test_a2a3_pto2_manual_scope_(api|runtime)' --output-on-failure`
  - `python -m pytest tests/st/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/test_manual_scope_validation.py --platform a2a3sim --device 0 -q`

### Real-device golden checks

Environment:

- platform: `a2a3`
- device: `9`
- PTO-ISA commit: `d96c8784`
- local package rebuilt with `pip install --no-build-isolation -e .`

Fresh hardware reruns passed for all four kept paged-attention paths:

- `examples/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/paged_attention`
  - `Case1`
  - `Case2`
- `examples/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/paged_attention_manual_scope`
  - `Case1`
  - `Case2`
- `tests/st/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/paged_attention_unroll`
  - `Case1`
  - `Case2`
- `examples/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/paged_attention_unroll_manual_scope`
  - `Case1`
  - `Case2`

## Fresh Benchmark Status

### Method

This benchmark block is the authoritative batch for the current cleaned branch.
Older measurements were removed because they were collected before the cleanup
pass or on different branch states.

- commit under test: `32fecc5`
- platform: `a2a3`
- device: `9`
- PTO-ISA commit: `d96c8784`
- rounds: `30`
- aggregation: trimmed average, dropping `10` low and `10` high rounds
- runner:
  - scene-test entrypoint for AUTO paths
  - `run_example.py` for manual-scope example paths
- benchmark mode: `--skip-golden`
- timing source: device log parsing with the same `orch_start/orch_end` logic
  as `tools/benchmark_rounds.sh`

Important reading rule:

- compare AUTO vs manual only within the same row
- do not compare `paged_attention` rows directly against
  `paged_attention_unroll` rows as if they were the same workload

### Results

| Example | Case | Auto Elapsed Trim (us) | Auto Orch Trim (us) | Manual Elapsed Trim (us) | Manual Orch Trim (us) | Elapsed Delta | Orch Delta |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `paged_attention` | `Case1` | 79.9 | 64.6 | 124.7 | 109.4 | +44.8 us (+56.1%) | +44.8 us (+69.3%) |
| `paged_attention` | `Case2` | 93.0 | 72.6 | 146.2 | 126.1 | +53.2 us (+57.2%) | +53.5 us (+73.7%) |
| `paged_attention_unroll` | `Case1` | 1134.5 | 777.4 | 1136.9 | 785.3 | +2.4 us (+0.2%) | +7.9 us (+1.0%) |
| `paged_attention_unroll` | `Case2` | 524.8 | 319.8 | 525.2 | 329.0 | +0.4 us (+0.1%) | +9.2 us (+2.9%) |

### Reading The Batch

- Non-unroll manual scope is materially slower than AUTO in this fresh batch.
  The regression is almost entirely orchestration time.
- Unroll manual scope stays close to AUTO in total elapsed time, but it still
  pays a measurable orchestration penalty.
- The current v0 branch is functionally correct on hardware, but it does not
  meet the earlier non-unroll performance target.

## Why Raw Non-unroll Looks Faster Than Unroll

The raw elapsed columns above are not a fair cross-workload comparison.
`paged_attention` and `paged_attention_unroll` are intentionally very different
problem sizes.

### Case Shape Comparison

| Example | Case | Batch | Num Heads | Head Dim | Block Size | Context Len |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `paged_attention` | `Case1` | 1 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 33 |
| `paged_attention_unroll` | `Case1` | 256 | 16 | 128 | 128 | 8192 |
| `paged_attention` | `Case2` | 1 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 128 |
| `paged_attention_unroll` | `Case2` | 64 | 64 | 128 | 64 | 8192 |

So the unroll example is not a tuned version of the same small test. It is the
production-scale workload.

### Device-log Evidence

From the fresh benchmark logs on device `9`:

- `paged_attention Case1` submitted `13` tasks total
- `paged_attention_unroll Case1` submitted `1280` tasks total

These numbers match the orchestration structure:

- non-unroll `Case1`
  - `batch=1`
  - `bn_this_batch=ceil(33 / 16)=3`
  - `q_loop=1`
  - per batch: `1 alloc + 3 * 4 kernel tasks = 13`
- unroll `Case1`
  - `batch=256`
  - `bn_this_batch=ceil(8192 / 128)=64`
  - `N_UNROLL=64`, so one unrolled group per batch
  - per batch: `1 alloc + 4 grouped kernel tasks = 5`
  - total: `256 * 5 = 1280`

The important result is therefore not:

- "non-unroll is faster than unroll"

The important result is:

- unroll processes a vastly larger workload, yet its runtime does not scale
  remotely in proportion to raw work size
- unroll dramatically reduces orchestration cost per unit of work

One simple normalization is orchestration time per submitted task:

| Example | Case | Orch Trim (us) | Submitted Tasks | Orch per Task (us) |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `paged_attention` | `Case1` | 64.6 | 13 | 4.97 |
| `paged_attention_unroll` | `Case1` | 777.4 | 1280 | 0.61 |

So unroll is not "worse" in the meaningful sense. Its absolute latency is
larger because the workload is massively larger, while its orchestration cost
per submitted task is much lower.

## Why Modifier Tensors Still Use TensorMap

The main correctness-sensitive runtime choice in v0 is still:

| Change | Files / Functions Touched | Why It Matters | Observed Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keep TensorMap for manual-scope modifier tensors | `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.cpp` `pto2_submit_mixed_task()` | V0 has no returned task-id handle for zero-output updater tasks. Explicit deps can describe `qk -> softmax -> pv -> update`, but they still cannot express `update(i) -> update(i+1)` when the updater only mutates existing tensors. TensorMap publication / lookup on `INOUT` / `OUTPUT_EXISTING` keeps those repeated updates ordered correctly. | Current branch passes all eight fresh hardware golden checks. The remaining unroll gap is small but still concentrated in orchestration, which is consistent with modifier tensors continuing to pay TensorMap cost. |

## Historical Optimization Notes

The current PR intentionally does not carry the broader optimization branch.
Those attempts were removed from the code to keep the PR scope small, but the
history is still useful and should stay documented here as historical context.

These entries are not claims about the current branch state. They record what
was tried on the earlier heavier line of work and whether it was kept there,
reverted there, or later dropped from this PR scope.

### Historical Kept Attempts On The Earlier Branch

| Optimization | Files / Functions Touched | Historical Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O(1) explicit-dep membership check | `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.cpp` `pto2_get_current_scope_task_slot()` `pto2_submit_mixed_task()` `pto2_scope_begin()` `pto2_prepare_task()`; `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.h`; `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_ring_buffer.h` | Large win on the old branch because it removed a linear current-scope scan from each `add_dep(...)` validation. |
| Exact per-scope epoch validation | `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.cpp` `pto2_get_current_scope_task_slot()` `pto2_scope_begin()` `pto2_prepare_task()`; `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.h`; `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_ring_buffer.h`; `tests/ut/cpp/test_a2a3_pto2_manual_scope_runtime.cpp` | Correctness fix that preserved the O(1) validation path while closing the stale-scope hole. |
| Skip redundant creator-retention when owner is already explicit | `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.cpp` `pto2_submit_mixed_task()` `pto2_append_explicit_manual_deps()` | Reduced duplicate submit-path work when explicit deps already named the producer. |
| Canonicalize explicit dep ids once per submit | `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.cpp` `pto2_submit_mixed_task()` | Small hotpath cleanup on the earlier branch. |
| Eager `start_offset` caching, remove hot-path recompute from payload init | `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/tensor.h` `Tensor::init()` `Tensor::init_with_view()` `Tensor::init_from_create_info()`; `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_runtime2_types.h` `PTO2TaskPayload::init()`; `tests/ut/cpp/test_a2a3_pto2_manual_scope_runtime.cpp` | Reduced the earlier branch's `param_copy` hotspot substantially, but this was later dropped from the PR to keep the diff tightly coupled to manual-scope v0 itself. |
| Cached allocator-state fast path before shared reload | `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_ring_buffer.h` `PTO2TaskAllocator::alloc()` `has_task_slot_capacity()` `try_alloc_with_last_alive()` | Reduced allocator overhead on the earlier branch, but this was also dropped from the PR because it is a general runtime optimization, not a manual-scope-v0-specific change. |

### Historical Reverted / Rejected Attempts

| Attempt | Files / Functions Touched | Historical Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fold output owner metadata into `payload->init()` to save the post-init output loop | `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/tensor.h`; `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_runtime2_types.h`; `src/a2a3/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.cpp` | Reverted on the earlier branch. End-to-end gains were not reliable and the code became harder to reason about. |
| Change `out_view` in paged-attention update from `INOUT` to `NO_DEP` | earlier `paged_attention` orchestration files on the heavy branch | Reverted. Real-device golden failed. |
| Change `out_view` in paged-attention update from `INOUT` to `OUTPUT_EXISTING` | earlier `paged_attention` orchestration files on the heavy branch | Reverted. Real-device golden also failed. |

## Risks

1. Manual scope still relies on orchestration authors to supply producer-flow
   explicit deps correctly.
2. V0 cannot fully replace TensorMap for modifier chains when the updater task
   does not return an output-backed task id.
3. Wrong scope metadata would still cause incorrect locality classification.
4. The current non-unroll benchmark gap is large enough that performance should
   not be described as improved relative to AUTO.

## Recommendation

Keep v0 narrow and explicit:

- same submit APIs as AUTO
- `Arg.add_dep(task_id)` only inside manual scope
- no delayed wiring
- no delayed linking
- immediate publish
- alloc returns `task_id`
- scope-depth metadata decides locality
- modifier tensors keep TensorMap chaining until the API can expose zero-output
  updater task ids in a lighter way

This is the smallest v0 design that is functionally correct on the current
hardware batch. The next optimization work should focus first on the
non-unroll orchestration regression without widening the API again.
