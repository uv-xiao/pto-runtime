# CUDA Backend Evaluation Notes

This page is the landing index for CUDA backend evaluation evidence. The
measurements are early runtime microbenchmarks, not end-to-end LLM serving
results. They follow the VDCores and MPK papers only at the evaluation-shape
level: fixed GPU work, repeated problem sizes, selected launch baselines,
local A100 runs, and remote H200 runs.

## Current Evidence

The latest full paired A100/H200 benchmark capture was taken at commit
`61cf96cd`, and the latest compact current-head paired gate uses artifact
label `dbb01406`. Supplemental tensor-shape and tensor-core captures were
taken at commits `c0ada3ad` and `0879aa9e`. The first cuBLAS library baseline
capture uses the `343924df` artifact label, and the first cuBLAS CUDA Graph
baseline capture is under `cublas-graph-compact-working`. The first
multi-baseline tensor shape sweep used the `6f9a0b78` artifact label, and the
latest multi-size tensor baseline sweep uses `e79edba2`:

- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) summarizes the latest
  `8x4x12` tensor-descriptor sweep, selected baselines, host-schedule unary
  and quad rows, scalar AXPY, scalar affine, triad, quad, generic-args, and
  graph-descriptor and unary-square descriptor rows, and headline
  interpretation.
- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) records the compact scalar-scale
  benchmark gate that adds `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_scale` to the selected
  paired benchmark path with A100/H200 report artifacts.
- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) also records the supplemental
  `8x4x12`, `16x16x64`, and `32x16x64` tensor-shape sweep for
  `pto_persistent_dag_tensor`.
- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) records a compact tensor-baseline
  size sweep comparing scalar tensor DAG, explicit-graph scalar tensor DAG,
  WMMA tensor-core DAG, and cuBLAS SGEMM rows for a `16x16x16` descriptor.
- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) records the compact `d361006f`
  paired gate that validates the default `16x16x16` tensor descriptor with
  scalar tensor DAG, WMMA tensor-core DAG, and cuBLAS rows in one current-head
  A100/H200 report.
- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) records the compact `dbb01406`
  paired gate that promotes the explicit graph-descriptor scratch-reuse DAG
  into the selected benchmark path.
- The supplemental graph tensor-tile sample under
  `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-graph-tensor-current-working/` validates
  `pto_persistent_dag_graph_tensor`, the explicit graph-descriptor variant of
  the scalar tiled-GEMM DAG, on A100 and H200.
- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) records the first selected
  benchmark row for `pto_persistent_dag_tensor_core`, a WMMA
  `m16n16k8` TF32/F32 generated-dispatch task followed by the same residual,
  gate, and fan-in tasks as the scalar tensor DAG.
- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) records the first
  `cublas_sgemm` library-backed tensor baseline row in the same compact
  selected-baseline report shape.
- [Current capture](evaluation-current.md) records the first
  `cublas_sgemm_graph` row, which captures the same warmed cuBLAS descriptor
  into a CUDA Graph and times graph replay on A100 and H200.
- [Historical captures](evaluation-history.md) preserve the previous
  accumulated benchmark notes, including earlier graph, stream, task-count,
  worker-grid, DAG-chain, scratch-reuse, and tensor-tile captures.

`tmp/cuda-backend/index.md` is generated by
`.agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_artifact_index.py`. It indexes
local benchmark, tensor-shape sweep, and smoke artifacts, including
tensor-tile descriptor shapes when the JSON payloads carry that metadata.
Persistent smoke rows also include repeat-run counts and per-launch completion
counts, which are the quick audit fields for graph-descriptor lifecycle reuse
captures.
Benchmark report directories now include `cuda-benchmark-dag-deltas.svg`,
which visualizes the signed device-time increment of each
`pto_persistent_dag_*` row over the matched `pto_persistent_dag` scheduler
baseline. Tensor-DAG and cuBLAS rows also produce
`cuda-benchmark-throughput.svg`, which normalizes the recorded
`rows x cols x inner` descriptor and tile count into median GF/s.
The compact smoke Markdown and SVG reports generated by
`.agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_smoke_report.py` expose the
same lifecycle fields when present. Tensor-core smoke rows also expose the
WMMA shape and input/accumulator types in the Markdown table, so the
per-artifact visual evidence and the local index agree.
The compact benchmark and tensor-sweep tables in
[Current capture](evaluation-current.md) can be regenerated from raw JSON with
`.agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_current_summary.py`, including
the selected benchmark tensor-throughput table via
`--section tensor-throughput` and graph scratch-reuse ratios via
`--section dag-shapes` when the capture includes
`pto_persistent_dag_graph_scratch_reuse`.
New benchmark and tensor-sweep Markdown reports embed source-paper provenance
for the VDCores and MPK notes kept under `tmp/sources/` and sanitized
local/remote command examples for reconstructing the run. Tensor sweeps also
include a workload description for each selected tensor baseline.
Validate a refreshed paired-current capture before updating committed docs
with `.agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_validate_capture.py`.
The paired benchmark runner wires that validator with expected generated
`dispatch_func_ids` for known persistent DAG rows, so a numerically passing
capture is still rejected if it ran the wrong CUDA device task sequence. It
also checks tensor descriptor metadata for tensor and cuBLAS rows, so a report
captured with the wrong `--tensor-rows`, `--tensor-cols`, or `--tensor-inner`
does not get copied into the current-evaluation tables.

## Baselines

- `direct_driver`: thin CUDA Driver API launch path for the same vector-add
  PTX kernel.
- `direct_driver_graph`: CUDA Graph replay of the same Driver API vector-add
  kernel, with graph instantiation outside the measured interval.
- `pto_host_schedule`: PTO CUDA host runtime C API and manifest dispatch.
- `pto_host_schedule_compiler`: same host runtime path using a
  `KernelCompiler(platform="cuda")` generated task-body wrapper and cached PTX.
- `pto_host_schedule_unary_square`: same generated host runtime path for the
  unary `(a, out, n)` ABI, using a square task body.
- `pto_host_schedule_quad`: same generated host runtime path for the
  four-input `(a, b, c, d, out, n)` ABI.
- `pto_persistent_device`: descriptor-array persistent executor.
- `pto_persistent_queue`: scheduler block plus bounded device ring queue.
- `pto_persistent_dag`: generated-dispatch-like task selection with fan-in
  counters.
- `pto_persistent_dag_chain`: five-task generated-dispatch DAG with a
  post-fan-in dependency chain.
- `pto_persistent_dag_reuse`: six-task generated-dispatch DAG that reuses a
  scratch buffer after the buffer's last dependent completes.
- `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_axpy`: generated-dispatch DAG that reads a
  `scalar0` task descriptor field for mixed tensor/scalar AXPY work before
  downstream fan-in.
- `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_scale`: generated-dispatch DAG that reads
  `scalar0` with one tensor input before downstream fan-in.
- `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_affine`: generated-dispatch DAG that reads
  `scalar0` and `scalar1` task descriptor fields for two-scalar affine work
  before downstream fan-in.
- `pto_persistent_dag_triad`: generated-dispatch DAG that reads a third tensor
  task descriptor field for three-input triad work before downstream fan-in.
- `pto_persistent_dag_quad`: generated-dispatch DAG that reads third and
  fourth tensor task descriptor fields for four-input work before downstream
  fan-in.
- `pto_persistent_dag_generic_args`: generated-dispatch DAG that reads generic
  tensor/scalar descriptor slots before downstream fan-in.
- `pto_persistent_dag_graph`: generated-dispatch DAG that reads an explicit
  runtime graph descriptor before downstream fan-in. This row validates the
  same graph-lowering shape used by `persistent_dag_graph_f32`.
- `pto_persistent_dag_graph_chain`: explicit graph-descriptor variant of the
  five-task chain DAG, validating that the benchmark path can time the chain
  shape from graph metadata rather than a fixed DAG adapter.
- `pto_persistent_dag_graph_scratch_reuse`: explicit graph-descriptor
  variant of the six-task scratch-reuse DAG, validating the benchmark path
  can time scratch-buffer reuse after the last consumer from graph metadata.
- `pto_persistent_dag_unary_square`: generated-dispatch DAG with a one-input
  square task body before downstream fan-in.
- `pto_persistent_dag_tensor`: four-task generated-dispatch DAG with a tiled
  GEMM task followed by residual, gate, and fan-in elementwise tasks.
- `pto_persistent_dag_graph_tensor`: explicit graph-descriptor variant of the
  tiled GEMM, residual, gate, and fan-in DAG.
- `pto_persistent_dag_tensor_core`: four-task generated-dispatch DAG with a
  block-wide WMMA `m16n16k8` TF32/F32 task followed by residual, gate, and
  fan-in elementwise tasks.
- `cublas_sgemm`: CUDA Runtime API plus cuBLAS
  `cublasSgemmStridedBatched` over the configured tensor descriptor. This is
  the first library-backed CUDA tensor baseline in the selected report.
- `cublas_sgemm_graph`: CUDA Runtime API plus cuBLAS captured into a CUDA
  Graph after handle warmup, with graph instantiation outside the measured
  interval and `cudaGraphLaunch` timed by CUDA events.
- `*_batch`: same-work rows comparing repeated host launches with one
  persistent launch over the same descriptor count.
- `pto_persistent_device_grid_batch`: direct persistent-device batch row with
  a swept number of CUDA worker blocks assigned to each task descriptor.

Ratios are relative to the matched reference for the same GPU, vector length,
and task count. For same-work batch rows, the reference is
`pto_host_schedule_batch`, not the one-task `pto_host_schedule` row. Stream
rows use `pto_stream_serial` as their reference.

## Reproduction

The committed workflow lives under
`.agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/`. The most commonly used commands
are documented in `.agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/SKILL.md`.

Use the paired runner to refresh the local A100 and remote H200 capture in one
step:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  python3 .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_benchmark.py
```

It runs the local benchmark, refreshes the remote `bizhaoh200` checkout,
copies the H200 artifact directory back, merges the JSON reports, validates
the combined artifact with the configured sizes/repeats/baselines, and rebuilds
the local artifact index. The remote checkout step uses bounded Git HTTPS
low-speed settings by default so a bad network fetch fails instead of
stranding the paired run, and the fetch is wrapped in a shell `timeout`.
When the remote checkout has already been updated by another path and Git
HTTPS is unhealthy on `bizhaoh200`, add `--skip-remote-refresh` to reuse that
checkout and still run the paired A100/H200 capture. In skip-refresh mode,
the runner reads the remote checkout commit and uses it in the H200 artifact
name; if local and remote commits differ, the combined artifact name includes
both commits. A skip-refresh dry run still performs the read-only remote
commit probe so the printed artifact paths are accurate.
When remote Git remains unhealthy and the local checkout is the source of
truth, add `--sync-remote-tree` to copy the current local tree to
`bizhaoh200` with `rsync` before running H200. This mode skips remote Git,
excludes `.venv`, `build`, and `tmp`, and labels both GPU artifacts with the
local commit. It syncs `.git` so the remote benchmark metadata reports the
same commit as the synced source tree.

Use the paired smoke runner when the goal is a fast real-data A100/H200 check
without requiring `torch` on the H200 environment:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  python3 .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_smoke.py \
    --op scale --sync-remote-tree --build-runtime
```

It captures host-schedule Worker smoke JSON on both GPUs, renders
`cuda-smoke-report.md` and `cuda-smoke-report.svg`, and refreshes
`tmp/cuda-backend/index.md`. It supports the same remote refresh,
`--skip-remote-refresh`, `--sync-remote-tree`, and `--dry-run` controls as the
paired benchmark runner. Use `--build-runtime` after changing CUDA runtime C++
so the synced H200 checkout does not run stale shared objects.

Refresh the local artifact index after adding or merging captures:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  python3 .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_artifact_index.py \
    --root tmp/cuda-backend
```

Validate the current paired capture before copying numbers into
[Current capture](evaluation-current.md):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  python3 .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_validate_capture.py \
    tmp/cuda-backend/<combined-capture>/cuda-benchmark.json \
    --preset compact-current
```

The default full paired benchmark shape uses:

- sizes: `1024,65536,1048576`
- repeats: `3`
- batch tasks: `2,6,12`
- worker blocks per task: `32,64,128,256`
- tensor descriptor: `16x16x16`
- local A100 PTX arch: `compute_80`
- remote H200 PTX arch: `compute_90`

The paired persistent smoke runner validates smoke artifacts before refreshing
the local index. Use `--skip-validation` only for intentional negative
scheduler-diagnostic captures. Standalone smoke validation uses:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  python3 .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_validate_smoke.py \
    tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_descriptor-repeat2-smoke-d3a86494/a100.json \
    tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_descriptor-repeat2-smoke-d3a86494/h200.json \
    --require-artifact a100 --require-artifact h200 \
    --expected-runtime persistent_device --expected-mode dag \
    --expected-dag-shape graph_descriptor --expected-repeat-runs 2 \
    --expected-completed-count 3 --expected-dispatch 9,2,1 \
    --expected-graph-fanin 0,0,2 --expected-graph-dependents 2,2 \
    --require-report-files
```

For tensor-tile smokes, add `--expected-tensor-tile ROWSxCOLSxINNER` to
require the descriptor shape recorded in the A100/H200 JSON payloads.
For generated-dispatch DAG smokes, the paired persistent-smoke runner also
passes `--expected-dispatch` for the requested DAG shape so a numerically
passing artifact must still prove the expected device task sequence.
For explicit graph-descriptor smokes, it also passes
`--expected-graph-fanin` and `--expected-graph-dependents` so the JSON payloads
must prove the expected runtime graph topology.
