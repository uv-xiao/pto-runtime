# CUDA Backend Status

This page tracks current implementation status against the CUDA backend
design. It distinguishes verified tracer-bullet behavior from remaining
design work so evaluation results are not mistaken for a complete backend.

## Implemented And Verified

### Platform And Runtime Discovery

- `cuda` maps to the `cuda/onboard` platform variant.
- `RuntimeBuilder(platform="cuda")` discovers both CUDA runtimes:
  `host_schedule` and `persistent_device`.
- `RuntimeBinaries` now exposes a role-keyed view through `role_paths` and
  `path_for_role(...)`. Ascend platforms map the existing `host`, `aicpu`,
  and `aicore` roles directly. CUDA build configs now declare native `host`
  and `device` targets; the legacy `aicpu_path` and `aicore_path` fields are
  compatibility aliases to the CUDA `device` artifact.

Evidence:

- `tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py`
- `tests/ut/py/test_runtime_builder.py`
- `tests/ut/py/test_runtime_compiler.py`
- `src/cuda/runtime/host_schedule/build_config.py`
- `src/cuda/runtime/persistent_device/build_config.py`
- `src/cuda/platform/onboard/device/CMakeLists.txt`
- `src/cuda/platform/onboard/host/pto_runtime_c_api.cpp`

### Host-Schedule Runtime

The CUDA `host_schedule` runtime is implemented as a real CUDA host runtime
slice. It supports:

- device initialization/finalization;
- device allocation and free;
- host-to-device and device-to-host copies;
- PTX module loading through the CUDA Driver API;
- prepared callable registration and unregistration;
- vector-add launch through `run_prepared`;
- a small non-blocking stream pool using callable `stream_id` metadata.

`KernelCompiler(platform="cuda").compile_cuda_host_schedule()` now compiles a
user-authored CUDA task body through the shared wrapper generator and writes a
cached host-schedule callable artifact under
`build/cache/cuda/onboard/host_schedule/callables/`. The generated host
wrapper can lower a task context into the current vector-add launch ABI, so
the artifact can be passed to `prepare_callable` and run with real device
data.

Evidence:

- `tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py` validates vector-add with real CUDA
  device data.
- The stream concurrency smoke validates two independent prepared callables
  on distinct streams.
- `simpler_setup.cuda_callable_compiler.prepare_cuda_host_schedule_callable()`
  builds the shared ctypes manifest for host-schedule compiler artifacts and
  preserves PTX/entry-name buffer lifetimes for `prepare_callable`.
- `PreparedCudaCallable` exposes `buffer_ptr()` / `buffer_size()`, and the L2
  Python `Worker.register(...)` path can prepare those raw CUDA callable
  blobs through `prepare_callable_from_blob`.
- L2 Python `Worker.run(...)` can launch backend-specific raw CUDA argument
  structs that expose `buffer_ptr()` / `buffer_size()`, so the host-schedule
  vector-add path no longer has to call `run_prepared` through `ctypes`.
- `tests/ut/py/test_cuda_kernel_compiler.py` covers the CUDA `KernelCompiler`
  entry point for host-schedule task bodies.
- `tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py` runs one host-schedule callable compiled
  by `KernelCompiler` through `prepare_callable` and validates real CUDA output
  data.
- `tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py` also runs the compiler-backed
  host-schedule vector-add through `Worker(level=2, platform="cuda")`,
  `Worker.register(...)`, device allocation/copy helpers, and `Worker.run(...)`
  with a real `CudaVectorAddArgs` struct.
- `SceneTestCase` L2 compilation accepts `CALLABLE["cuda"]` specs for
  `host_schedule`, compiles them through `KernelCompiler(platform="cuda")`,
  registers the prepared raw callable through the normal L2 `Worker`, builds
  `CudaVectorAddArgs`, `CudaVectorUnaryArgs`, `CudaVectorScaleArgs`,
  `CudaVectorAxpyArgs`, `CudaVectorAffineArgs`, and `CudaVectorTernaryArgs`
  from normal `TaskArgsBuilder` CPU tensors/scalars, and validates real
  copied-back CUDA output data.

### Persistent-Device Runtime

The CUDA `persistent_device` runtime is implemented as a set of tracer-bullet
execution modes:

- direct descriptor-array persistent executor;
- scheduler/worker bounded ready queue;
- bounded ring wraparound with capacity smaller than task count;
- generated-dispatch DAG with fan-in counters;
- five-task DAG-chain runtime graph descriptor;
- six-task scratch-reuse DAG descriptor;
- tensor-tile DAG descriptor with rows/cols/inner/stride metadata;
- tensor-core tile DAG descriptor with a block-wide CUDA WMMA
  `m16n16k8`/TF32/F32 generated-dispatch task body;
- scalar-argument DAG descriptors for single-tensor scale,
  mixed tensor/scalar AXPY-style, and two-scalar affine task bodies.
- third tensor-argument DAG descriptor for a generated-dispatch triad task
  body.
- fourth tensor-argument DAG descriptor for a generated-dispatch quad task
  body.
- generic tensor/scalar argument slots in the persistent DAG descriptor, with
  a generated-dispatch task reading `tensor_args[0]`, `tensor_args[1]`,
  `scalar_args[0]`, and `scalar_args[1]`.
- unary generated-dispatch DAG descriptor for a task body that reads one
  tensor input and leaves the second tensor pointer unused.
- device-side scheduler diagnostics for unsupported generated-dispatch
  `func_id` values, invalid dependent task IDs, and out-of-range dependent
  spans, fan-in underflow, and initial-fan-in mismatch.
- device-side scheduler diagnostics for malformed graphs that have no
  zero-fan-in root, or that publish some ready roots but exhaust work before
  every task completes.
- explicit resource-policy smoke metadata for the current single scheduler
  block, configurable queue/DAG worker blocks, direct-mode worker blocks per
  task, and callable `stream_id`.
- prepared-callable repeat-run lifecycle metadata for direct, queue, and DAG
  modes, with queue counters/flags and DAG graph state reset between launches.

The persistent DAG path compiles generated CUDA source with `nvcc` and stores
the generated source, PTX, and manifest under
`build/cache/cuda/onboard/persistent_device/callables/`.
The smoke and benchmark path now reaches that artifact compiler through
`KernelCompiler(platform="cuda").compile_cuda_persistent_device(...)`, which
accepts task source files plus `func_id` metadata, lowers task-body style
sources through the same `CudaTaskBody` wrapper contract as `host_schedule`,
and composes the generated dispatch entry.
`SceneTestCase` L2 compilation accepts `CALLABLE["cuda"]` specs for
`persistent_device`, compiles task-body sources through the same
`KernelCompiler` entry point, registers the prepared raw callable through the
normal L2 `Worker`, builds `persistent_dag_fork_join_f32`,
`persistent_dag_chain_f32`, `persistent_dag_reuse_f32`, and
`persistent_dag_scalar_scale_f32`, `persistent_dag_scalar_axpy_f32`, and
`persistent_dag_scalar_affine_f32` scalar descriptors,
`persistent_dag_tensor_tile_f32` state objects,
`persistent_dag_triad_f32` third-tensor descriptors,
`persistent_dag_quad_f32` fourth-tensor descriptors,
`persistent_dag_generic_args_f32` generic tensor/scalar argument descriptors,
`persistent_dag_graph_f32` explicit and tensor-flow-inferred graph
descriptors, and
`persistent_dag_unary_square_f32` unary descriptors, and
`persistent_dag_tensor_core_tile_f32` WMMA tensor-core descriptors from normal
`TaskArgsBuilder` CPU tensors, and validates real copied-back CUDA output
data. The scene-test persistent-device compiler path also forwards callable
`stream_id` into the prepared CUDA manifest, so these L2 tests can run on a
selected non-default runtime stream. After each persistent-device scene-test
launch, the L2 path now copies back device scheduler counters and raises on
nonzero scheduler errors or incomplete DAG execution, so scheduler failures
are visible even when a diagnostic test intentionally skips golden comparison.
The no-torch
persistent smoke path also validates a generated-dispatch triad descriptor
with a third tensor pointer field, a quad descriptor with third and fourth
tensor pointer fields, a generic-argument descriptor, and a generated-dispatch
unary-square descriptor with a single tensor input.
The host-schedule scene path also accepts the neutral
`elementwise_binary_f32` adapter for non-addition task bodies that still use
the current `(a, b, out, n)` launch ABI. It accepts `elementwise_unary_f32`
for unary `(a, out, n)` task bodies, `elementwise_scale_f32` for scalar
`(a, out, alpha, n)` task bodies, and `elementwise_axpy_f32` for mixed
tensor/scalar `(a, b, out, alpha, n)` task bodies. It also accepts
`elementwise_affine_f32` for two-scalar affine
`(a, b, out, alpha, beta, n)` task bodies and `elementwise_triad_f32` for
three-input `(a, b, c, out, n)` task bodies, `elementwise_quad_f32` for
four-input `(a, b, c, d, out, n)` task bodies, and
`elementwise_generic_args_f32` for the host-schedule generic tensor/scalar
argument slots. The original two-slot launch ABI remains available, and the
host runtime also accepts the four tensor/scalar slots already represented by
`CudaVectorGenericArgs`.
The no-torch Worker smoke can validate that same non-addition host-schedule
ABI with `--op mul`, unary ABI with `--op square`, scalar ABI with
`--op scale`, mixed tensor/scalar ABI with `--op axpy`, and two-scalar affine
ABI with `--op affine`, three-input ABI with `--op triad`, and four-input ABI
with `--op quad`, which keeps H200 coverage available when the remote Python
environment lacks `torch`.

Evidence:

- `tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py` runs persistent-device smoke tests with
  real CUDA data when `nvcc` is available.
- `tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py` covers generated dispatch,
  device scheduler diagnostic fields, tensor descriptor fields, shared
  task-body wrapper generation, host-schedule and persistent-device manifest
  writing, and cache reuse.
- `tests/ut/py/test_cuda_kernel_compiler.py` covers both CUDA
  `KernelCompiler` entry points.
- `simpler_setup/cuda_preflight.py` gives CUDA real-data tests one shared
  preflight path for `nvcc`, `nvidia-smi`, and driver visibility.
- `simpler_setup/cuda_callable_compiler.py` contains the generated-dispatch
  source renderer, shared task-body wrapper renderer, prepared-callable
  manifest helpers, and offline `nvcc` compile helper.

### Evaluation And Reporting

The current evaluation setup covers local A100 and remote H200 runs with:

- `direct_driver`;
- `direct_driver_graph`;
- `pto_host_schedule`;
- `pto_host_schedule_compiler`;
- `pto_host_schedule_unary_square`;
- `pto_host_schedule_quad`;
- `pto_host_schedule_generic_args`;
- `pto_persistent_device`;
- `pto_persistent_queue`;
- `pto_persistent_dag`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_chain`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_reuse`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_axpy`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_scale`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_affine`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_triad`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_quad`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_generic_args`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_graph`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_graph_diamond`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_unary_square`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_tensor`;
- `pto_persistent_dag_graph_tensor`;
- same-work batch rows;
- worker-grid batch rows.

The latest full paired capture at commit `61cf96cd` uses the `8x4x12` tensor
descriptor, sizes `1024,65536,1048576`, three repeats, task counts `2,6,12`,
and worker-grid values `32,64,128,256`. It includes the compiler-backed
host-schedule row, unary square host-schedule row, quad host-schedule row, and
`pto_persistent_dag_scalar_axpy`, `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_affine`, and
`pto_persistent_dag_triad` on both A100 and H200. It also includes
`pto_persistent_dag_quad`, validating fourth tensor task descriptor fields,
`pto_persistent_dag_generic_args`, validating indexed generic tensor/scalar
argument slots, and `pto_persistent_dag_unary_square`, validating unary
persistent DAG arguments in the full paired benchmark path. It also includes
`pto_persistent_dag_graph`, validating the explicit runtime graph descriptor
path in the full paired benchmark path.

A compact paired benchmark at commit `945016c3` adds
`pto_persistent_dag_graph_diamond` to the benchmark matrix and validates the
new row on A100 and H200. It uses `N=1024`, one repeat, no batch rows, the
default `16x16x16` tensor descriptor for tensor rows, and writes raw JSON,
Markdown, and SVG reports under
`tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-945016c3/`. The validator checked `48`
combined rows, required command examples, source-paper provenance, report
files, zero scheduler errors, and the graph-diamond generated-dispatch
sequence. The graph-diamond row reported dispatch `[9,2,1,2,1]`, five
completed tasks, A100 `device_wall_ns=36864`, and H200
`device_wall_ns=31744`.

The latest current-head compact paired validation at commit `2aedb40f` uses
the default `16x16x16` tensor descriptor so the scalar tensor DAG,
`pto_persistent_dag_tensor_core`, and `cublas_sgemm` rows are all runnable in
the same paired report. It runs `N=1024`, one repeat, `batch_tasks=2`, and
`worker_blocks_per_task=4`, producing `58` combined rows under
`tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-2aedb40f/`. The paired runner validated
required baselines, expected generated-dispatch sequences, command examples,
tensor descriptor metadata, source-paper provenance, and Markdown and SVG
report files. It also validates the host-schedule generic-args benchmark row.
Selected A100 device times for host, host-generic, base-DAG,
persistent-generic, tensor, tensor-core, cuBLAS, and grid-batch were
`29696/43008/44032/29696/41984/41984/49152/40960 ns`; H200 reported
`17920/36032/38112/31168/47008/32543/51520/32896 ns`. All PTO persistent DAG
rows reported zero device scheduler errors.

The compact paired benchmark gate at artifact label `a46db551` promotes
`pto_persistent_dag_scalar_scale` into the selected benchmark path. It uses
`N=4096`, one repeat, no batch rows, and default `16x16x16` tensor descriptor
metadata. The paired runner synced the working tree to H200, captured A100
and H200 reports, merged `44` rows, and validated required baselines,
source-paper provenance, command examples, report files, and zero scheduler
errors under `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-a46db551/`. The scalar-scale
row reported dispatch `[11,2,1]`, `scalar0=2.0`, `device_wall_ns=37888` on
A100, and `device_wall_ns=27744` on H200.

The supplemental tensor-shape sweep at commit `c0ada3ad` runs
`pto_persistent_dag_tensor` on local A100 and remote H200 for `8x4x12`,
`16x16x64`, and `32x16x64` descriptors with `N=4096` and two repeats. All
12 rows passed with dispatch sequence `[3,1,2,1]`; the descriptor tile counts
were `128`, `16`, and `8`, respectively. The raw JSON, Markdown, and SVG
artifacts are under `tmp/cuda-backend/tensor-shape-sweep-c0ada3ad/`. This is
still scalar tiled GEMM scheduler evidence, not tensor-core throughput.

The first tensor-core persistent DAG smoke at commit `390eda4f` runs
`tensor_core_tile` on local A100 and remote H200 with a `16x16x16` descriptor.
The generated dispatch sequence is `[10,1,2,1]`; func_id `10` is a block-wide
WMMA `m16n16k8` task body with TF32 inputs and F32 accumulation. The paired
runner validated both artifacts with zero scheduler errors, tensor descriptor
`16x16x16`, `completed_count=4`, and generated Markdown/SVG report files under
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-tensor_core_tile-16x16x16-smoke-390eda4f/`.
This is callable and scheduler evidence for tensor-core task bodies, not a
tuned throughput result.

The first tensor-core selected-baseline benchmark row at commit `0879aa9e`
runs `pto_persistent_dag_tensor_core` on local A100 and remote H200 with the
same `16x16x16` descriptor. The compact selected-baseline report uses
`N=256`, one repeat, no batch rows, and the usual JSON/Markdown/SVG benchmark
outputs. The tensor-core DAG row measured `37888 ns` device time on A100 and
`38656 ns` on H200, compared with `40960 ns` and `43392 ns` for the scalar
`pto_persistent_dag_tensor` row in the same report. The raw artifacts are
under `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-tensor-core-current-0879aa9e/`. Benchmark
reports now also write `cuda-benchmark-dag-deltas.svg`, which plots each
`pto_persistent_dag_*` row's signed device-time increment over the matched
`pto_persistent_dag` scheduler baseline, and
`cuda-benchmark-throughput.svg`, which plots median GF/s for tensor-DAG and
cuBLAS rows with recorded tensor tile descriptors.

The first cuBLAS library-backed tensor baseline adds `cublas_sgemm` to the
same compact selected-baseline report shape. It uses CUDA Runtime API events
around a warm cuBLAS `cublasSgemmStridedBatched` call over the configured
`16x16x16` descriptor. In the paired A100/H200 capture under
`tmp/cuda-backend/combined-cublas-current-343924df/`, the row measured
`48128 ns` device time on A100 and `58623 ns` on H200. The matched
`pto_persistent_dag_tensor_core` rows in that report measured `33792 ns` and
`32960 ns`. This row is a CUDA library launch/compute comparison point, not a
PTO runtime path.

The tensor shape sweep script now accepts `--baselines` and `--sizes`, so one
paired A100/H200 sweep can compare scalar tensor DAG, the explicit graph
tensor DAG, WMMA tensor-core DAG, and cuBLAS SGEMM rows across descriptor
shapes and problem sizes. The multi-repeat size-sweep report at commit
`e79edba2` uses a `16x16x16` descriptor with `N=256`, `4096`, and `65536`,
three repeats, and the artifact under
`tmp/cuda-backend/tensor-shape-sweep-e79edba2/`. It writes raw rows,
VDCores/MPK provenance metadata, per-baseline workload descriptions, a median
summary table with normalized GFLOP/s, and SVG charts for median device time
and median GFLOP/s with sample counts. Median device times are: A100
scalar/tensor-core/cuBLAS at
`N=256`
`47104/47104/43007 ns`, `N=4096` `79872/71680/36864 ns`, and `N=65536`
`587616/470368/38911 ns`; H200 at `N=256` `30560/28160/50496 ns`, `N=4096`
`88576/49888/37055 ns`, and `N=65536` `1032896/390368/36127 ns`. Normalized
throughput at `N=65536` is A100 scalar/tensor-core/cuBLAS
`3.57/4.46/53.90` GFLOP/s and H200 `2.03/5.37/58.05` GFLOP/s. The PTO
tensor-core row improves over the scalar tensor row as repeated tile work
grows, while the cuBLAS baseline shows the remaining gap to a tuned CUDA
library path.
A current-head one-repeat graph-tensor sweep at
`tmp/cuda-backend/tensor-shape-sweep-0e84fd26/` adds
`pto_persistent_dag_graph_tensor` to the same `16x16x16` tensor-baseline
comparison at `N=256` and `4096`. The validated median device times were:
A100 scalar/graph/tensor-core/cuBLAS `47104/47104/45056/48128 ns` at
`N=256` and `80896/80896/82944/39935 ns` at `N=4096`; H200
`29568/32800/27040/51711 ns` at `N=256` and
`89472/89152/51872/35904 ns` at `N=4096`. The graph tensor row uses the same
dispatch `3,1,2,1` as the scalar tensor row while exercising the explicit
runtime graph descriptor path.
`cuda_validate_tensor_sweep.py` checked the expected A100/H200 rows,
baselines, sizes, shape, three repeats, report files, and PTO dispatch
sequences before the numbers were copied into docs. New tensor-sweep captures
can also require sanitized local/remote command examples and source-paper
metadata before publishing with `--require-command-examples` and
`--require-source-papers`; the source-paper gate verifies the referenced
files exist under `tmp/sources/`.
Benchmark captures now use the same VDCores/MPK `source_papers` metadata
contract and sanitized command-example metadata contract as tensor sweeps.
They can be gated with `cuda_validate_capture.py` plus
`--require-command-examples`, `--require-zero-scheduler-errors`, and
`--require-source-papers` before new paired-current numbers are published.
The existing real-data paired A100/H200 capture from commit `61cf96cd` was
re-rendered through the updated report path under
`tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-61cf96cd-command-source-gate/`, and the
paired-current validator passed with `--require-command-examples` and
`--require-source-papers`.

A current-HEAD one-repeat compact tensor sweep at commit `a5fd4bfd` validated
that gate against real local A100 and remote H200 data. The artifact under
`tmp/cuda-backend/tensor-shape-sweep-a5fd4bfd/` includes sanitized local
sample, remote sample, and remote tree-sync commands in generated Markdown and
JSON. The validation required A100/H200 rows, scalar tensor DAG, WMMA tensor
DAG, cuBLAS SGEMM, `N=256`, `16x16x16`, report files, command examples, and
source-paper metadata, and PTO dispatch sequences.

## Latest Local Verification

The focused CUDA test set was run from the project-local virtual environment.
The CUDA backend tests run separately so the shell exit status is authoritative
even when hardware tests take longer than the default tool wait window:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_kernel_compiler.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py -q
```

Result: `34 passed`.

After adding persistent-device scene-test plumbing, the same focused CUDA set
was rerun:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_kernel_compiler.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q
```

Result: `36 passed`.

The CUDA scene-test file was also run on the remote H200 checkout after
pushing this change:

```bash
ssh bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q'
```

Result: `1 passed, 1 skipped`. The compile/plumbing test passed; the real-data
scene case skipped because the remote Python environment does not have
`torch`.

The remote H200 real-data Worker smoke was run through the no-torch smoke
script:

```bash
ssh bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_smoke.py \
     --runner worker --device 0 --n 1024 --block-dim 256 \
     --arch compute_90 --no-build'
```

Result: `status=pass`, `runner=worker`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`,
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-worker-task-body-compute_90`,
`device_wall_ns=12736`.

After adding persistent-device scene-test plumbing, the CUDA scene-test file
was rerun on the remote H200 checkout:

```bash
ssh bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q'
```

Result: `2 passed, 2 skipped`. The host-schedule and persistent-device
compile/plumbing tests passed; both real-data scene cases skipped because the
remote Python environment does not have `torch`.

The remote H200 persistent DAG real-data smoke was run through the no-torch
smoke script:

```bash
ssh bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python \
     .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
     --device 0 --task-count 3 --n 1024 --arch compute_90 \
     --mode dag --queue-capacity 2'
```

Result: `status=pass`, `runtime=persistent_device`,
`ptx_arch=compute_90`,
`ptx_source=nvcc-persistent-generated-dispatch-compute_90`,
`completed_count=3`, `device_wall_ns=41152`.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py -q
```

Result: `16 passed`.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_benchmark_report.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_kernel_compiler.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_worker/test_ensure_prepared.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_worker/test_host_worker.py -q
```

Result: `87 passed`.

The host-schedule Worker raw-args smoke was run locally on A100:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_smoke.py \
    --runner worker --device 0 --n 1024 --block-dim 256 \
    --arch compute_80 --no-build
```

Result: `status=pass`, `runner=worker`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-worker-task-body-compute_80`.

The no-torch host-schedule Worker multiply smoke was captured on both GPUs
with `--output-json` and rendered through `cuda_smoke_report.py`:

- A100: `status=pass`, `mode=worker/mul`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`
- H200: `status=pass`, `mode=worker/mul`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`
- Report:
  `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-mul-smoke-output-json/cuda-smoke-report.md`
- SVG: `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-mul-smoke-output-json/cuda-smoke-report.svg`

The paired no-torch smoke runner was also verified with remote tree sync:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_smoke.py \
    --op mul --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `mode=worker/mul`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`device_wall_ns=20480`; H200 `status=pass`, `mode=worker/mul`,
`ptx_arch=compute_90`, `device_wall_ns=20000`. The generated artifacts are
under `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-mul-smoke-d5788710/`.

The scalar host-schedule Worker smoke was captured on both GPUs with runtime
rebuild enabled:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_smoke.py \
    --op scale --sync-remote-tree --build-runtime
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `mode=worker/scale`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`device_wall_ns=8192`; H200 `status=pass`, `mode=worker/scale`,
`ptx_arch=compute_90`, `device_wall_ns=12544`. The generated artifacts are
under `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-scale-smoke-4240a4ba/`.

The unary host-schedule Worker smoke was captured on both GPUs with runtime
rebuild enabled:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_smoke.py \
    --op square --sync-remote-tree --build-runtime
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `mode=worker/square`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`device_wall_ns=9216`; H200 `status=pass`, `mode=worker/square`,
`ptx_arch=compute_90`, `device_wall_ns=16192`. The generated artifacts are
under `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-square-smoke-4cdde399/`.

The docs and skill updates were checked with targeted `pre-commit` runs and
`git diff --check` before commit.

The paired benchmark capture was refreshed at commit `db0acd4c` after
syncing the local checkout to the remote H200 host:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_benchmark.py \
    --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: A100 `label=a100-current-db0acd4c`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`; H200
`label=h200-current-db0acd4c`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`. Both reports use
`ptx_source=nvcc-*`, include generated compiler, unary host-schedule, and
persistent-device rows, and are merged in
`tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-db0acd4c/`.

The local A100 persistent DAG smoke was run through the persistent-device
`KernelCompiler` entry point with task-body style DAG sources:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 3 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 2
```

Result: `status=pass`, `runtime=persistent_device`,
`ptx_source=nvcc-persistent-generated-dispatch-compute_80`,
`completed_count=3`.

The same task-body style persistent DAG smoke was run on the remote H200
checkout after pushing `6f1497b5`:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && git pull --ff-only >/dev/null && \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   python3 .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
     --device 0 --task-count 3 --n 1024 --arch compute_90 \
     --mode dag --queue-capacity 2'
```

Result: `status=pass`, `runtime=persistent_device`,
`ptx_source=nvcc-persistent-generated-dispatch-compute_90`,
`completed_count=3`.

After adding persistent-device scheduler diagnostics, the focused CUDA test
set was rerun locally:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_kernel_compiler.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q
```

Result: `38 passed`.

The local A100 persistent DAG smoke now reports zero device scheduler errors
on the normal generated-dispatch path:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 3 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 2
```

Result: `status=pass`, `device_scheduler_errors={"count": 0, "code": 0,
"task_id": 0}`, `completed_count=3`.

The synthetic invalid-dispatch shape was also run locally to verify that an
unsupported generated-dispatch `func_id` is surfaced before output mismatch
checks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 1 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 1 --dag-shape bad_func_id
```

Result: expected non-zero exit with `persistent dag scheduler error code=1
task_id=0 count=1`.

The synthetic invalid-dependent shape was run locally to verify that a runtime
graph descriptor cannot release a task ID outside the descriptor array:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 1 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 1 --dag-shape bad_dependent
```

Result: expected non-zero exit with `persistent dag scheduler error code=2
task_id=7 count=1`.

The synthetic invalid-dependent-range shape was run locally to verify that a
runtime graph descriptor cannot read outside the dependents array:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 1 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 1 --dag-shape bad_dependent_range
```

Result: expected non-zero exit with `persistent dag scheduler error code=3
task_id=0 count=1`.

The synthetic fan-in-underflow shape was run locally to verify that a runtime
graph descriptor cannot decrement a dependent task's fan-in below zero:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 3 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 2 --dag-shape bad_fanin_underflow
```

Result: expected non-zero exit with `persistent dag scheduler error code=4
task_id=2 count=1`.

The synthetic initial-fan-in mismatch shape was run locally to verify that a
runtime graph descriptor cannot start from fan-in counters that disagree with
task metadata:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 1 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 1 --dag-shape bad_initial_fanin
```

Result: expected non-zero exit with `persistent dag scheduler error code=5
task_id=0 count=1`.

The synthetic no-root shape was run locally to verify that a runtime graph
descriptor cannot deadlock workers by declaring no zero-fan-in task:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 1 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 1 --dag-shape bad_no_root
```

Result: expected non-zero exit with `persistent dag scheduler error code=6
task_id=0 count=1`.

The synthetic unreachable-task shape was run locally to verify that a runtime
graph descriptor cannot deadlock workers by publishing one root but leaving
another task behind a dangling fan-in counter:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 2 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 1 --dag-shape bad_unreachable \
    --worker-blocks 2
```

Result: expected non-zero exit with `persistent dag scheduler error code=7
task_id=1 count=1`.

The same scheduler-diagnostic slice was verified on the remote H200 checkout
after pushing this change:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   git fetch origin design/nvidia-backend >/dev/null && \
   git checkout -B design/nvidia-backend FETCH_HEAD >/dev/null && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
     --device 0 --task-count 3 --n 1024 --arch compute_90 \
     --mode dag --queue-capacity 2'
```

Result: `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`,
`device_scheduler_errors={"count": 0, "code": 0, "task_id": 0}`,
`completed_count=3`.

The H200 invalid-dispatch check returned the expected diagnostic:
`persistent dag scheduler error code=1 task_id=0 count=1`.

The H200 invalid-dependent check returned the expected diagnostic:
`persistent dag scheduler error code=2 task_id=7 count=1`.

The H200 invalid-dependent-range check returned the expected diagnostic:
`persistent dag scheduler error code=3 task_id=0 count=1`.

The H200 fan-in-underflow check returned the expected diagnostic:
`persistent dag scheduler error code=4 task_id=2 count=1`.

The H200 initial-fan-in mismatch check returned the expected diagnostic:
`persistent dag scheduler error code=5 task_id=0 count=1`.

The H200 no-root check returned the expected diagnostic:
`persistent dag scheduler error code=6 task_id=0 count=1`.

The H200 unreachable-task check returned the expected diagnostic:
`persistent dag scheduler error code=7 task_id=1 count=1`.

The current unreachable-task slice was also checked on H200 through pytest
after syncing the working tree:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py \
     -q -rs -k "unreachable or smoke_runs_dispatch_dag" --platform cuda'
```

Result: `10 passed, 25 deselected`. The command printed the known PTO-ISA SSH
refresh warning before passing.

The persistent callable lifecycle path has repeat-run smoke support that
prepares the callable once and launches it multiple times. Direct mode reuses
the prepared callable, queue mode resets the ready queue counters and flags,
and DAG mode resets the graph state between launches:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 5 --n 4096 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 2 --dag-shape chain --repeat-runs 2
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 4 --n 4096 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode queue --queue-capacity 2 --repeat-runs 2
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-chain-repeat2-smoke-4bcd56c4/`
contains A100 and H200 JSON plus Markdown/SVG reports. Local A100 returned
`launch_completed_counts=[5,5]`, `launch_device_wall_ns=[44032,41984]`, and
zero scheduler errors. Remote H200 returned `launch_completed_counts=[5,5]`,
`launch_device_wall_ns=[45760,39616]`, and zero scheduler errors.

The queue-mode lifecycle capture at
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-queue-repeat2-smoke-0a4447c0/` verifies that the
ready-queue counters and flags are reset between prepared-callable launches.
Local A100 returned `launch_completed_counts=[4,4]` and
`launch_device_wall_ns=[22528,14336]`. Remote H200 returned
`launch_completed_counts=[4,4]` and `launch_device_wall_ns=[25280,14272]`.

After adding invalid-dependent, dependent-range, fan-in-underflow,
initial-fan-in, no-root, and unreachable-task scheduler diagnostics, the CUDA
backend/codegen tests were rerun locally:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py -q --platform cuda
```

Result: `55 passed`. The full local CUDA scene-test file was also rerun with
`--platform cuda` and reported `42 passed`.

After adding the third-tensor persistent DAG scene-test arg builder, the new
ctypes-backed real-data scene test was checked on remote H200 without requiring
`torch`:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PTO_ISA_ROOT=/data/shibizhao/pto-cu/build/pto-isa \
   PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
     tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py::test_scene_test_runs_cuda_persistent_device_triad_with_ctypes_data -q'
```

Result: `1 passed`.

After adding shared CUDA preflight skip reporting, the local A100-focused test
set was rerun:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_preflight.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q
```

Result: `25 passed`.

After adding the tensor-tile persistent DAG scene-test arg builder, the
focused CUDA suite was rerun locally on A100:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_kernel_compiler.py -q
```

Result: `39 passed`.

The same branch tip was checked on the remote H200 checkout. The scene-test
file passed its compile/plumbing cases and skipped the real-data cases because
the remote Python environment still lacks `torch`:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   git fetch origin design/nvidia-backend >/dev/null && \
   git checkout -B design/nvidia-backend FETCH_HEAD >/dev/null && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q'
```

Result: `2 passed, 3 skipped`.

The no-torch tensor-tile persistent DAG smoke was also run on H200:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
     --device 0 --task-count 4 --n 4096 --arch compute_90 \
     --mode dag --queue-capacity 2 --dag-shape tensor_tile'
```

Result: `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[3, 1, 2, 1]`, `completed_count=4`,
`device_scheduler_errors={"count": 0, "code": 0, "task_id": 0}`.

After adding chain and reuse persistent DAG scene-test arg builders, the
focused local CUDA scene/codegen set was rerun:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py -q
```

Result: `27 passed`. The new real-data chain and reuse scene tests both ran
through the local A100 CUDA L2 Worker path.

The same chain and reuse DAG shapes were checked on the remote H200 through
the no-torch persistent smoke path:

```bash
CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 5 --n 1024 --arch compute_90 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 3 --dag-shape chain

CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 6 --n 1024 --arch compute_90 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 3 --dag-shape scratch_reuse
```

Result: both returned `status=pass` with zero device scheduler errors.

After adding paired persistent-smoke automation, the chain DAG smoke was
captured on local A100 and remote H200 with tree sync and compact report
generation:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape chain --task-count 5 --queue-capacity 3 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-chain-smoke-e1fa429b/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The A100 row returned `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_80`, `device_wall_ns=29696`; the H200 row returned
`status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, `device_wall_ns=33152`.

After adding tensor descriptor flags to the paired persistent-smoke runner,
the non-square tensor-tile DAG smoke was captured on local A100 and remote
H200 with tree sync:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape tensor_tile --task-count 4 --queue-capacity 2 \
    --n 4096 --tensor-rows 8 --tensor-cols 4 --tensor-inner 12 \
    --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-tensor_tile-8x4x12-smoke-ad45b69c/`
contains `a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The A100 row returned `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_80`, `device_wall_ns=82944`; the H200 row returned
`status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, `device_wall_ns=49536`. Both rows
reported `dispatch_func_ids=[3,1,2,1]`, tensor shape `8x4x12`, `128` tiles,
and zero device scheduler errors.

After adding tensor descriptor validation to the smoke validator, the same
non-square tensor-tile DAG was captured with prepared-callable repeat reuse:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape tensor_tile --task-count 4 --queue-capacity 2 \
    --n 768 --tensor-rows 8 --tensor-cols 4 --tensor-inner 12 \
    --repeat-runs 2 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-tensor_tile-8x4x12-repeat2-smoke-223425b6/`
contains A100/H200 JSON plus Markdown/SVG reports. The paired runner then
validated both artifacts with `expected-tensor-tile=8x4x12`,
`repeat_runs=2`, `launch_completed_counts=[4,4]`, zero scheduler errors, and
the generated report files. The A100 row reported
`launch_device_wall_ns=[48128,36864]`; H200 reported
`launch_device_wall_ns=[54944,27040]`.

The preflight and CUDA scene-test subset was also run on the remote H200
checkout after pushing this change:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   git fetch origin design/nvidia-backend >/dev/null && \
   git checkout -B design/nvidia-backend FETCH_HEAD >/dev/null && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
     tests/ut/py/test_cuda_preflight.py \
     tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q'
```

Result: `6 passed, 2 skipped`. The skips are the real-data scene cases that
still require `torch` in the remote Python environment; the compile/plumbing
and preflight checks passed.

After adding native CUDA `device` build roles, both CUDA runtimes were rebuilt
locally and on H200. `RuntimeBuilder(platform="cuda")` reported
`libcuda_device_runtime.so` for the `device` role in `host_schedule` and
`persistent_device`; the legacy `aicpu_path` and `aicore_path` attributes
aliased the same device artifact.

The local A100 no-build host-schedule Worker smoke passed after the rebuild:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_smoke.py \
    --runner worker --device 0 --n 1024 --block-dim 256 \
    --arch compute_80 --no-build
```

Result: `status=pass`, `mode=worker/add`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`device_wall_ns=40960`.

The two-scalar affine host-schedule Worker smoke was captured on local A100
and remote H200 after adding the ABI:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_smoke.py \
    --op affine --sync-remote-tree --build-runtime
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-affine-smoke-dd026085/` contains A100 and
H200 JSON plus Markdown/SVG reports. A100 reported `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_80`, and `device_wall_ns=16384`; H200 reported
`status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, and `device_wall_ns=41760`.

The three-input triad host-schedule Worker smoke was captured on local A100
and remote H200 after adding the `(a, b, c, out, n)` ABI:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_smoke.py \
    --op triad --sync-remote-tree --build-runtime
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-triad-smoke-1af18449/` contains A100 and
H200 JSON plus Markdown/SVG reports. A100 reported `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_80`, and `device_wall_ns=22528`; H200 reported
`status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, and `device_wall_ns=42496`.

The local A100 and remote H200 persistent-device DAG smokes also passed after
building the native `device` role:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 3 --n 1024 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 2
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `device_wall_ns=30720`,
`device_scheduler_errors={"count":0,"code":0,"task_id":0}`; H200
`status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, `device_wall_ns=24896`, zero scheduler
errors.

After promoting the scalar AXPY DAG to a benchmark baseline, the benchmark
report tests passed locally and the new single-baseline path was checked on
both GPUs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_persistent_dag_scalar_axpy \
    --sizes 1024 --arch compute_80
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[4,2,1]`, `scalar_args={"scalar0":1.5}`,
`device_scheduler_errors={"count":0,"code":0,"task_id":0}`; H200
`status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, `dispatch_func_ids=[4,2,1]`,
`scalar_args={"scalar0":1.5}`, zero scheduler errors.

After promoting the unary host-schedule ABI to a benchmark baseline, the new
single-baseline path was checked on both GPUs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_host_schedule_unary_square \
    --sizes 1024 --arch compute_80
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-task-body-wrapper-unary-square-compute_80`,
`device_wall_ns=8192`; H200 `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`,
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-task-body-wrapper-unary-square-compute_90`,
`device_wall_ns=13888`.

After adding the unary row to the default paired benchmark, the validator was
updated to compare CUDA `float32` square results. The previous exact Python
integer-square comparison failed at `N=65536` because CUDA stores
single-precision output:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_host_schedule_unary_square \
    --sizes 65536 --arch compute_80
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-task-body-wrapper-unary-square-compute_80`,
`device_wall_ns=848864`.

After adding a two-scalar persistent DAG descriptor, the focused local CUDA
test set was rerun:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_benchmark_report.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py -q
```

Result: `133 passed`.

The two-scalar affine DAG smoke was captured on local A100 and remote H200
with tree sync and compact report generation:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape scalar_affine --task-count 3 --queue-capacity 2 \
    --n 4096 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-scalar_affine-smoke-469f55cd/`
contains `a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The A100 row returned `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_80`, `dispatch_func_ids=[5,2,1]`,
`scalar_args={"scalar0":1.5,"scalar1":0.5}`, `device_wall_ns=28672`;
the H200 row returned `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[5,2,1]`, the same scalar args, and
`device_wall_ns=35584`. Both rows reported zero device scheduler errors.

After adding a third tensor pointer to the persistent DAG descriptor, the
triad DAG smoke was captured on local A100 and remote H200 with tree sync and
compact report generation:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape triad --task-count 3 --queue-capacity 2 \
    --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-triad-smoke-3a3bcdb1/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The A100 row returned `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_80`, `dispatch_func_ids=[6,2,1]`,
`tensor_args={"c":"tmp0"}`, `device_wall_ns=27648`; the H200 row returned
`status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, the same dispatch IDs and tensor args,
and `device_wall_ns=24832`. Both rows reported zero device scheduler errors.

After adding a unary generated-dispatch task body, the unary-square DAG smoke
was captured on local A100 and remote H200 with tree sync and compact report
generation:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape unary_square --task-count 3 --queue-capacity 2 \
    --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-unary_square-smoke-cb01f013/`
contains `a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The A100 row returned `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_80`, `dispatch_func_ids=[7,1,1]`, and
`device_wall_ns=30720`; the H200 row returned `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_90`, the same dispatch IDs, and `device_wall_ns=31136`.
Both rows reported zero device scheduler errors.

After promoting the unary-square DAG to a benchmark baseline, the new
single-baseline path was checked on both GPUs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_persistent_dag_unary_square \
    --sizes 4096 --arch compute_80
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[7,1,1]`,
`device_scheduler_errors={"count":0,"code":0,"task_id":0}`, and
`device_wall_ns=43008`; H200 `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, the same
dispatch IDs, zero scheduler errors, and `device_wall_ns=45184`.

After promoting the triad DAG to a benchmark baseline, the new single-baseline
path was checked on both GPUs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_persistent_dag_triad \
    --sizes 4096 --arch compute_80
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-triad-baseline/` contains A100 and H200
JSON plus Markdown/SVG reports. A100 returned `status=pass`,
`ptx_arch=compute_80`, `dispatch_func_ids=[6,2,1]`,
`tensor_args={"c":"tmp0"}`, and `device_wall_ns=34816`; H200 returned
`status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, the same dispatch IDs and tensor args,
and `device_wall_ns=33536`. Both rows reported zero device scheduler errors.

After promoting the two-scalar affine DAG to a benchmark baseline, the focused
report tests passed locally and the new single-baseline path was checked on
both GPUs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_persistent_dag_scalar_affine \
    --sizes 4096 --arch compute_80
```

Result: A100 `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[5,2,1]`,
`scalar_args={"scalar0":1.5,"scalar1":0.5}`,
`device_scheduler_errors={"count":0,"code":0,"task_id":0}`,
`device_wall_ns=31744`; H200 `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[5,2,1]`, the same scalar args, zero scheduler errors,
and `device_wall_ns=30560`.

The full paired benchmark was then refreshed with scalar affine, triad, quad,
and unary-square rows in the default persistent baseline set:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_benchmark.py \
    --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-ba99b593/` contains
`cuda-benchmark.json`, `cuda-benchmark.md`, `cuda-benchmark.svg`, and
`cuda-benchmark-ratios.svg`. The combined JSON has `666` samples, including
`18` `pto_persistent_dag_scalar_affine` samples and `18`
`pto_persistent_dag_triad` samples, `18`
`pto_persistent_dag_quad` samples, and `18`
`pto_persistent_dag_unary_square` samples. The compact DAG table reports
quad ratios versus `pto_persistent_dag` of `1.05x`, `1.19x`, and `1.19x` on
A100 for `N=1024,65536,1048576`, and `0.98x`, `1.07x`, and `1.01x` on H200
for the same sizes. The quad smoke and paired benchmark golden path now
matches NVCC's generated `mul.f32` plus `fma.rn.f32` sequence for
`a * b + c * d`, so the fourth tensor descriptor row is recorded as
correctness and scheduler-shape evidence. Throughput conclusions still need a
tuned tensor workload.

The combined capture was validated with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_validate_capture.py \
    tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-ba99b593/cuda-benchmark.json \
    --preset paired-current
```

Result: `validated tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-ba99b593/cuda-benchmark.json`.

After adding `persistent_dag_unary_square_f32` to the normal SceneTestCase L2
persistent-device argument builders, the CUDA scene-test file was rerun
locally on A100:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q
```

Result: `30 passed`. The new unary persistent scene slice also uses a
ctypes-backed real-data case so it can run on the H200 checkout without
`torch`.

The same unary scene-test slice was run on the remote H200 checkout after
syncing the current local tree:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -k unary_square'
```

Result: `2 passed, 28 deselected`.

After adding the four-input host-schedule ABI, the no-torch Worker quad smoke
was captured on local A100 and remote H200 with runtime rebuild enabled:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_smoke.py \
    --op quad --sync-remote-tree --build-runtime
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-quad-smoke-4327698e/` contains `a100.json`,
`h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and `cuda-smoke-report.svg`. A100
reported `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_80`, and `device_wall_ns=21504`;
H200 reported `status=pass`, `ptx_arch=compute_90`, and
`device_wall_ns=18752`. The local A100 quad smoke was also checked at
`N=65536` to exercise the same CUDA fused multiply-add rounding path used by
`ctx->a[i] * ctx->b[i] + ctx->c[i] * ctx->d[i]`.

After promoting the four-input host-schedule ABI to a benchmark baseline, the
focused single-baseline path was checked on both GPUs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_host_schedule_quad --sizes 4096 \
    --repeats 1 --arch compute_80
```

The same command was run on H200 with `--arch compute_90`. Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/host-quad-baseline-working/` contains `a100.json` and
`h200.json`. The A100 row reported `status=pass`,
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-task-body-wrapper-quad-compute_80`, and
`device_wall_ns=8192`; H200 reported `status=pass`,
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-task-body-wrapper-quad-compute_90`, and
`device_wall_ns=24960`.

The full paired current benchmark was refreshed at commit `c0dc1372`.
Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-c0dc1372/` contains the raw JSON,
Markdown report, median-device SVG, and ratio SVG. The combined JSON has
`684` samples, including `18` `pto_host_schedule_quad` samples and `18`
`pto_persistent_dag_quad` samples. The paired-current validator reported:
`validated tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-c0dc1372/cuda-benchmark.json`.

After adding generic persistent DAG tensor/scalar argument slots, the
`generic_args` smoke was run locally on A100 and remotely on H200 with a tree
sync. The graph uses generated-dispatch `func_id` sequence `[9, 2, 1]`; the
first task computes from the base tensor fields plus `tensor_args[0]`,
`tensor_args[1]`, `scalar_args[0]`, and `scalar_args[1]`, and the final task
joins with an independent `a * b` branch. Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-generic_args-smoke-7c99f607/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. Both runs reported zero scheduler errors and
argument metadata
`scalar_args[0]=1.5,scalar_args[1]=0.25,tensor_args[0]=tmp0,tensor_args[1]=tmp3`.
The same descriptor shape now also has normal `SceneTestCase` L2 coverage
through `persistent_dag_generic_args_f32`, using ctypes-backed CPU tensors so
the path remains usable on the H200 host without requiring `torch`. The
focused local command passed on A100:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  -q -k generic_args_with_ctypes --platform cuda
```

The same command was run on H200 after syncing the working tree to
`bizhaoh200`; it passed with `1 passed, 35 deselected`.

After promoting generic persistent DAG tensor/scalar argument slots to a
benchmark baseline, the focused single-baseline path was checked on both GPUs:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_persistent_dag_generic_args --sizes 4096 \
    --repeats 1 --arch compute_80
```

The same command was run on H200 with `--arch compute_90`. Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-generic-args-baseline-working/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The A100 row reported `status=pass`,
`ptx_source=nvcc-persistent-generated-dispatch-compute_80`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[9,2,1]`, and `device_wall_ns=30720`; H200 reported
`status=pass`, `ptx_source=nvcc-persistent-generated-dispatch-compute_90`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[9,2,1]`, and `device_wall_ns=33600`.

The full paired current benchmark was then refreshed at commit `61cf96cd`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_benchmark.py \
    --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-61cf96cd/` contains
`cuda-benchmark.json`, `cuda-benchmark.md`, `cuda-benchmark.svg`, and
`cuda-benchmark-ratios.svg`. The combined JSON has `720` samples, including
`18` `pto_persistent_dag_generic_args` samples and `18`
`pto_persistent_dag_graph` samples. All rows reported pass
status. The paired-current validator reported:
`validated tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-61cf96cd/cuda-benchmark.json`.
The compact DAG table now includes `Graph Descriptor/DAG`; the H200 graph
descriptor ratios versus `pto_persistent_dag` are `0.95x`, `1.05x`, and
`1.00x` for `N=1024,65536,1048576`, while the A100 ratios are `1.08x`,
`1.19x`, and `1.05x`. Treat the DAG-shape rows as correctness and scheduler
shape evidence rather than tuned throughput claims.

The compact paired-current gate was refreshed again at commit `8e868bfe`
after the tensor-core scene-test and persistent `stream_id` plumbing changes.
It uses the WMMA-compatible `16x16x16` tensor descriptor:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_benchmark.py \
    --sizes 1024 --repeats 1 --batch-tasks 2 \
    --worker-blocks-per-task 4 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-8e868bfe/` contains
`cuda-benchmark.json`, `cuda-benchmark.md`, `cuda-benchmark.svg`,
`cuda-benchmark-ratios.svg`, `cuda-benchmark-dag-deltas.svg`, and
`cuda-benchmark-throughput.svg`. The combined JSON has `56` samples and the
compact-current validator reported:
`validated tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-8e868bfe/cuda-benchmark.json`.
This capture validates all 28 selected baselines on A100 and H200, including
`pto_persistent_dag_scalar_scale`, `pto_persistent_dag_graph_diamond`, and
`pto_persistent_dag_graph_tensor`. Selected A100 device times for
host/base-DAG/tensor/tensor-core/cuBLAS/grid-batch were
`29696/48128/38912/36864/53247/49152 ns`; H200 reported
`14880/36512/48960/33632/37631/30176 ns`.

The compact paired-current gate was refreshed at commit `2aedb40f` after
adding the host-schedule generic-args benchmark row. It uses the same command
shape, `N=1024`, one repeat, `batch_tasks=2`, `worker_blocks_per_task=4`, and
the WMMA-compatible `16x16x16` tensor descriptor.

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-2aedb40f/` contains
`cuda-benchmark.json`, `cuda-benchmark.md`, `cuda-benchmark.svg`,
`cuda-benchmark-ratios.svg`, `cuda-benchmark-dag-deltas.svg`, and
`cuda-benchmark-throughput.svg`. The combined JSON has `58` samples and the
compact-current validator reported:
`validated tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-2aedb40f/cuda-benchmark.json`.
This capture validates all 29 selected baselines on A100 and H200, including
`pto_host_schedule_generic_args`. Selected A100 device times for host,
host-generic, base-DAG, persistent-generic, tensor, tensor-core, cuBLAS, and
grid-batch were `29696/43008/44032/29696/41984/41984/49152/40960 ns`; H200
reported `17920/36032/38112/31168/47008/32543/51520/32896 ns`.

Earlier result: `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-d361006f/` contains
`cuda-benchmark.json`, `cuda-benchmark.md`, `cuda-benchmark.svg`, and
`cuda-benchmark-ratios.svg`; it also writes
`cuda-benchmark-dag-deltas.svg`. New reports also write
`cuda-benchmark-throughput.svg` for tensor and cuBLAS rows. The combined JSON
has `50` samples and the paired-current validator reported:
`validated tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-d361006f/cuda-benchmark.json`.
This capture proves the default paired workflow now keeps
`pto_persistent_dag_tensor`, `pto_persistent_dag_tensor_core`, and
`cublas_sgemm` in one validated current-head report on A100 and H200.

The compact paired-current gate was refreshed at commit `0b3c1699` after
adding persistent DAG no-progress diagnostics. It uses the same command shape
and validates command examples, source-paper provenance, and generated report
files:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_benchmark.py \
    --sizes 1024 --repeats 1 --batch-tasks 2 \
    --worker-blocks-per-task 4 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-0b3c1699/` contains
`cuda-benchmark.json`, `cuda-benchmark.md`, `cuda-benchmark.svg`,
`cuda-benchmark-ratios.svg`, and `cuda-benchmark-dag-deltas.svg`. Regenerated
reports also include `cuda-benchmark-throughput.svg`. The combined JSON has
`50` samples and the validator reported:
`validated tmp/cuda-backend/combined-current-0b3c1699/cuda-benchmark.json`.
Selected A100 device times for
host/base-DAG/tensor/tensor-core/cuBLAS/grid-batch were
`33792/61440/44032/59392/60416/41984 ns`; H200 reported
`14848/31936/44576/36096/40959/28768 ns`.

## Remaining Gaps

### Kernel Compiler Integration

Host-schedule task-body compilation and persistent-device generated dispatch
now have first `KernelCompiler` entry points. Both paths can consume
`CudaTaskBody` style sources. CUDA prepared-callable artifacts can be staged
through the L2 Python `Worker` registration path. The normal scene-test flow
can compile and run host-schedule CUDA vector-add, binary elementwise, unary
square, scalar scale, axpy, two-scalar affine, three-input triad, quad, and
generic tensor/scalar callable specs and persistent-device
fork/join, chain, reuse, scalar scale, scalar AXPY, scalar affine, and
tensor-tile DAG callable specs, plus third-tensor persistent triad and
unary-square callable specs, end to end.
The fourth-tensor persistent quad callable spec also runs end to end through
ctypes-backed real data. The host-schedule quad callable spec also runs
through both the normal `SceneTestCase` L2 path and the no-torch Worker smoke
path. The host-schedule generic-args callable spec now has ctypes-backed
scene tests, so it runs on H200 without requiring `torch`; it lowers the
original two-slot `tensor_args[0:2]` and `scalar_args[0:2]` path, plus the
four-slot `tensor_args[0:4]` and `scalar_args[0:4]` path, through the host
runtime launch ABI. A generic `persistent_dag_graph_f32`
adapter can now lower explicit
runtime graph descriptors with per-task `func_id`, dependency lists, fan-in,
temporary buffers, generic tensor slots, and scalar slots through the same L2
`SceneTestCase` path. The adapter now allocates default-sized temporaries for
graph task `out` names that do not match existing input/output tensors, so the
`temporaries` map is only needed for non-default temporary sizes. It also
supports a first dependency-inference slice: when a graph task omits
`dependents`, the adapter infers its outgoing edges from tensor flow by
mapping earlier `out` producers to later `a`/`b`/`c`/`d` and `tensor_args`
reads. The inference is per task, so mixed descriptors can keep explicit
dependency lists for some tasks while inferring omitted edges for the
remaining tasks.

The host-schedule generic-args adapter was checked with a failing test first,
then local A100 and remote H200 real-data ctypes scene tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q \
  -k 'builds_cuda_elementwise_generic_args' --platform cuda

PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q \
  -k 'host_schedule_elementwise_generic_args_with_ctypes_data' \
  --platform cuda

ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -rs -k host_schedule_elementwise_generic_args_with_ctypes_data \
     --platform cuda'
```

Results: the local unit check reported `1 passed, 55 deselected`, the local
A100 real-data scene reported `1 passed, 55 deselected`, and the H200
real-data scene reported `1 passed, 55 deselected` after the known PTO-ISA SSH
refresh warning.

The same generic host-schedule ABI is now covered by the no-torch Worker
smoke runner, so it can be captured without the `SceneTestCase` framework:

```bash

```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-generic_args-smoke-72c8186c/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The artifact validator accepted both rows with
`runtime=host_schedule` and `mode=worker/generic_args`; the A100 row reported
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-worker-task-body-generic_args-compute_80` and
`device_wall_ns=35840`, while the H200 row reported
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-worker-task-body-generic_args-compute_90` and
`device_wall_ns=15488`.

After widening host-schedule generic args to the four tensor/scalar slots
already present in `CudaVectorGenericArgs`, the new `generic_args4`
ctypes `SceneTestCase` and no-torch Worker smoke were run on A100 and H200.
Focused local checks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q \
  -k 'builds_cuda_elementwise_generic_args' --platform cuda

  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_benchmark_report.py -q \
  -k 'generic_args4_helpers or generic_args_helpers_use_aux_tensor'
```

The paired no-torch Worker smoke was captured with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python .venv/bin/python \
  .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_smoke.py \
    --op generic_args4 --sync-remote-tree --build-runtime
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/worker-generic_args4-smoke-03ed75da/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The artifact validator accepted both rows with
`runtime=host_schedule` and `mode=worker/generic_args4`; the A100 row
reported
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-worker-task-body-generic_args4-compute_80` and
`device_wall_ns=26624`, while the H200 row reported
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-worker-task-body-generic_args4-compute_90` and
`device_wall_ns=19552`.

The same host-schedule generic-args path is now a benchmark baseline:
`pto_host_schedule_generic_args`. It compiles a generated task-body wrapper
for the generic tensor/scalar packet and uses the same indexed tensor/scalar
values as the smoke path:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python .venv/bin/python \
  .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_host_schedule_generic_args \
    --sizes 4096 --repeats 1 --arch compute_80 \
    --label host-generic-args-baseline-a100
```

Result: `tmp/cuda-backend/host-generic-args-baseline-working/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-benchmark.json`, `cuda-benchmark.md`, and
SVG report files. The capture validator accepted both A100 and H200 rows with
`baseline=pto_host_schedule_generic_args`, `N=4096`, source-paper provenance,
and report files. The A100 row reported
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-task-body-wrapper-generic-args-compute_80` and
`device_wall_ns=32768`; the H200 row reported
`ptx_source=kernel-compiler-task-body-wrapper-generic-args-compute_90` and
`device_wall_ns=17664`.

The graph-descriptor adapter was checked with focused local tests:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  -q -k 'graph_args or graph_edges or graph_temporaries or mixed_graph' \
  --platform cuda

.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  -q -k graph_with_ctypes --platform cuda
```

Result: the focused descriptor and real-data graph tests passed locally on
A100. The full CUDA scene-test file was also rerun locally and reported
`48 passed`.

The mixed explicit/inferred graph path was also run on the remote H200 after
syncing the working tree:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -rs -k mixed_graph_with_ctypes --platform cuda'
```

Result: `1 passed, 47 deselected`. The command printed the known PTO-ISA SSH
refresh warning before passing.

The graph adapter now also forwards tensor-tile descriptor fields from each
graph task: rows, columns, inner dimension, leading dimensions, and per-tile
strides. This lets an explicit `persistent_dag_graph_f32` descriptor run the
same scalar tiled-GEMM first task as `persistent_dag_tensor_tile_f32`, then
feed residual, gate, and fan-in elementwise tasks. The focused red/green test
first failed with `rows == 0`, then passed after descriptor-field lowering.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q -k graph_tensor_tile_args \
  --platform cuda

PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py -q -k 'graph_tensor_tile' \
  --platform cuda
```

Result: the second command reported `2 passed, 52 deselected` on the local
A100 path, covering both the struct descriptor and a real-data ctypes scene.
The full local CUDA scene-test file was also rerun after this adapter and
reported `54 passed`. The same no-torch real-data scene was run on the remote
H200:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -rs -k graph_tensor_tile_with_ctypes_data --platform cuda'
```

Result: `1 passed, 53 deselected`. The command printed the known PTO-ISA SSH
refresh warning before passing.

The same explicit graph tensor-tile shape is now part of the persistent smoke
tooling as `--dag-shape graph_tensor_tile`. It records both graph dependency
metadata and tensor-tile descriptor metadata in the smoke JSON, then validates
the paired A100/H200 artifacts with expected dispatch `3,1,2,1`, completed
count `4`, repeat count `2`, tensor descriptor `16x16x16`, and generated
Markdown/SVG report files.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 4 --n 512 --arch compute_80 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 2 --dag-shape graph_tensor_tile \
    --repeat-runs 2 --tensor-rows 16 --tensor-cols 16 --tensor-inner 16 \
    --output-json tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_tensor_tile-16x16x16-repeat2-working/a100.json
```

The H200 run used the same command after syncing the working tree, with
`--arch compute_90` and output
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_tensor_tile-16x16x16-repeat2-working/h200.json`.
The report and validator commands then produced:

```text
tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_tensor_tile-16x16x16-repeat2-working/cuda-smoke-report.md
tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_tensor_tile-16x16x16-repeat2-working/cuda-smoke-report.svg
validated tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_tensor_tile-16x16x16-repeat2-working/a100.json,
tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_tensor_tile-16x16x16-repeat2-working/h200.json
```

Result summary: A100 reported `device_wall_ns=98304`, H200 reported
`device_wall_ns=67968`, and both reported zero scheduler errors,
`launch_completed_counts=[4,4]`, dispatch `[3,1,2,1]`, and
`graph_descriptor.dependents=[1,2,3,3]`.

The explicit graph tensor-tile path is also exposed as the
`pto_persistent_dag_graph_tensor` benchmark baseline. It uses
`dag_shape=graph_tensor_tile`, receives the same `--tensor-rows`,
`--tensor-cols`, and `--tensor-inner` descriptor flags as the scalar tensor
DAG, and records both graph dependency metadata and tensor descriptor metadata
in the benchmark JSON and Markdown report. A one-repeat A100/H200 sample at
`N=512`, `16x16x16` is under
`tmp/cuda-backend/combined-graph-tensor-current-working/`. The capture
validated source-paper metadata, sanitized command examples, generated report
files, zero scheduler errors, and expected dispatch `[3,1,2,1]`. The sample
device times were `51200 ns` on A100 and `38080 ns` on H200.

The persistent scalar-scale scene-test adapter was then added to cover the
single-tensor plus scalar descriptor shape on the persistent-device runtime.
It compiles a generated-dispatch `func_id=11` task body, runs it before the
existing multiply/add fan-in branch, and uses ctypes-backed CPU tensors so the
same selector can run on H200 without `torch`.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
    -q -k scalar_scale --platform cuda

ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -rs -k scalar_scale --platform cuda'
```

Result: local A100 reported `2 passed, 48 deselected`; remote H200 reported
`2 passed, 48 deselected` after the known PTO-ISA SSH refresh warning. The
full local CUDA scene-test file was also rerun after this adapter and reported
`50 passed`.

The same scalar-scale task body was promoted to the no-torch standalone
persistent DAG smoke so it can be captured without the full scene-test
framework. The smoke uses generated-dispatch `func_id` sequence `[11,2,1]`,
with the first task computing `tmp0 = scalar0 * a`, an independent multiply
branch computing `tmp1 = a * b`, and the final task adding both branches.
Focused local coverage:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_benchmark_report.py \
    -q -k 'scalar_scale' --platform cuda

PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest \
    tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py::test_cuda_persistent_device_smoke_runs_dispatch_dag_scalar_scale \
    -q --platform cuda
```

Results: `2 passed, 146 deselected` for the shape/paired-runner unit tests,
and `1 passed` for the local A100 real-data CUDA smoke.

The paired A100/H200 smoke was then captured with a tree sync:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape scalar_scale --task-count 3 --queue-capacity 2 \
    --sync-remote-tree
```

Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-scalar_scale-smoke-e9c9f5f2/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The paired runner validated both artifacts with
`runtime=persistent_device`, `mode=dag`, `dag_shape=scalar_scale`,
`completed_count=3`, `dispatch_func_ids=[11,2,1]`, `scalar0=2.0`, zero
scheduler errors, and generated report files. The A100 row reported
`device_wall_ns=40960` and `host_wall_ns=61301`; H200 reported
`device_wall_ns=25856` and `host_wall_ns=34808`.

The same DAG shape was then promoted to the selected benchmark path as
`pto_persistent_dag_scalar_scale`. Focused benchmark/report tests and a local
A100 single-baseline sample were run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_benchmark_report.py \
    -q -k 'scalar_scale or worker_and_dag_tables or old_captures_without_scalar_affine or include_all_default_persistent or include_batch_mode' \
    --platform cuda

PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_persistent_dag_scalar_scale \
    --sizes 4096 --repeats 1 --arch compute_80 \
    --label scalar-scale-baseline-a100
```

Results: the focused report tests passed with `6 passed, 144 deselected`; the
local A100 single-baseline sample reported `status=pass`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[11,2,1]`, `scalar0=2.0`, and
`device_wall_ns=47104`.

The same real-data ctypes graph test was run on the remote H200 after syncing
the working tree:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -k inferred_graph_with_ctypes --platform cuda'
```

Result: `1 passed, 43 deselected`. The remote command also printed the known
PTO-ISA SSH refresh warning before the selected CUDA test passed.

The same real-data graph path was then run without an explicit `temporaries`
map, so `tmp0` and `tmp1` were allocated from task outputs:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -k auto_temp_graph_with_ctypes --platform cuda'
```

Result: `1 passed, 45 deselected`. The command printed the known PTO-ISA SSH
refresh warning before passing.

The tensor-core tile descriptor was then added to the same normal L2
`SceneTestCase` path as `persistent_dag_tensor_core_tile_f32`. Its first task
uses block-wide generated dispatch with `func_id=10`, while the remaining
residual, gate, and fan-in tasks reuse the scalar tensor DAG shape. Focused
local A100 coverage:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
    -q -k 'tensor_core_tile_args or tensor_core_tile_with_ctypes_data' \
    --platform cuda
```

Result: `2 passed, 39 deselected`. The full local CUDA scene-test file was
then rerun and reported `41 passed`.

The no-torch ctypes tensor-core scene test was also run on H200 after syncing
the working tree:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -rs -k "tensor_core_tile_with_ctypes_data" --platform cuda'
```

Result: `1 passed, 40 deselected`. The H200 venv lacks `torch`, so the
torch-backed tensor-core scene test is local-only there; the ctypes version
validates the same L2 `Worker` and `TaskArgsBuilder` path with real CUDA data.
The command also printed the known PTO-ISA SSH refresh warning before passing.

The persistent-device scene-test compiler path now also forwards
`CALLABLE["cuda"]["stream_id"]` into the prepared callable manifest. A focused
local A100 check used `stream_id=1` in the compile/plumbing test and the
no-torch tensor-core ctypes scene test:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
    -q -k 'compiles_cuda_persistent_device_callable or tensor_core_tile_with_ctypes_data' \
    --platform cuda
```

Result: `2 passed, 39 deselected`.

The same non-default-stream tensor-core ctypes scene test was then run on H200
after syncing the working tree. Result: `1 passed, 40 deselected`; the command
printed the known PTO-ISA SSH refresh warning before passing.

The same normal L2 persistent-device scene-test path now also checks
device-side scheduler diagnostics after `Worker.run`. A bad explicit graph
with unsupported `func_id=99` raises
`CUDA persistent DAG scheduler error code=1 task_id=0 count=1` even with
`skip_golden=True`, while a good explicit graph still validates real copied
data. Focused local A100 coverage:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
    -q -k 'reports_cuda_persistent_scheduler_errors or graph_with_ctypes or tensor_core_tile_with_ctypes_data' \
    --platform cuda
```

Result: `3 passed, 39 deselected`. The full local CUDA scene-test file was
then rerun and reported `42 passed`.

The diagnostic and good-graph ctypes tests were also run on H200 after
syncing the working tree:

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=8 bizhaoh200 \
  'cd /data/shibizhao/pto-cu && \
   CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH \
   PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
     -q -rs -k "reports_cuda_persistent_scheduler_errors or graph_with_ctypes" \
     --platform cuda'
```

Result: `3 passed, 41 deselected`. The command printed the known PTO-ISA SSH
refresh warning before passing.

The explicit graph-descriptor path has now been promoted into the benchmark
scripts as `pto_persistent_dag_graph`, using `dag_shape=graph_descriptor`.
This row uses the generated-dispatch `func_id` sequence `[9,2,1]`, generic
tensor slots `tensor_args[0]=tmp0,tensor_args[1]=tmp3`, scalar slots
`scalar_args[0]=1.5,scalar_args[1]=0.25`, and the explicit runtime graph
metadata `fanin=[0,0,2]` and `dependents=[2,2]`.

Focused local test coverage for the benchmark/report wiring:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_benchmark_report.py \
  -q --platform cuda
```

Result: `108 passed`.

The focused single-baseline path was checked on A100:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_benchmark.py \
    --single-baseline pto_persistent_dag_graph --sizes 4096 \
    --repeats 1 --arch compute_80
```

The same command was run on H200 with `--arch compute_90` and the remote venv
Python. Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph-baseline-working/` contains `a100.json`,
`h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and `cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The A100
row reported `status=pass`,
`ptx_source=nvcc-persistent-generated-dispatch-compute_80`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[9,2,1]`, and `device_wall_ns=36864`; H200 reported
`status=pass`, `ptx_source=nvcc-persistent-generated-dispatch-compute_90`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[9,2,1]`, and `device_wall_ns=31424`.

The paired persistent-smoke runner also supports `graph_descriptor`, so the
explicit graph path can be captured with the same A100/H200 lifecycle workflow
as the fixed DAG shapes. A repeat-run lifecycle smoke was captured at commit
`5139ba23` with automatic smoke artifact validation enabled:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape graph_descriptor --task-count 3 --queue-capacity 2 \
    --repeat-runs 2 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_descriptor-repeat2-smoke-5139ba23/`
contains `a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The paired runner then ran
`cuda_validate_smoke.py`, which accepted both JSON payloads, required the
`a100` and `h200` artifacts, checked `runtime=persistent_device`,
`mode=dag`, `dag_shape=graph_descriptor`, `repeat_runs=2`,
`launch_completed_counts=[3,3]`, `dispatch_func_ids=[9,2,1]`, zero scheduler
errors, and the generated report files. The A100 row reported
`device_wall_ns=51200` and `host_wall_ns=74021`; H200 reported
`device_wall_ns=51616` and `host_wall_ns=71847`. This validates that the
explicit graph descriptor path can reuse one prepared generated-dispatch
callable across two launches after resetting fan-in, ready flags, counters,
and scratch/output buffers.

The paired persistent-smoke runner now also requires expected generated
dispatch sequences for the existing DAG shapes: `chain`, `fork_join`,
`scratch_reuse`, tensor-tile and tensor-core-tile, scalar AXPY/scale/affine,
triad, quad, unary-square, `generic_args`, and `graph_descriptor`. The focused
unit selector for these paired workflow builders passed with `8 passed, 142
deselected`, after first failing because the validation command omitted those
`--expected-dispatch` checks.

The generic-argument descriptor path was then captured with repeat-run
lifecycle reuse on A100 and H200:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape generic_args --task-count 3 --queue-capacity 2 \
    --repeat-runs 2 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-generic_args-repeat2-smoke-6574c43b/` contains
`a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The paired runner validated
`runtime=persistent_device`, `mode=dag`, `dag_shape=generic_args`,
`repeat_runs=2`, `launch_completed_counts=[3,3]`,
`dispatch_func_ids=[9,2,1]`, zero scheduler errors, and generated report
files. A100 reported per-launch device times `[44032,25600]`, total
`device_wall_ns=69632`, and `host_wall_ns=106096`. H200 reported per-launch
device times `[21088,19808]`, total `device_wall_ns=40896`, and
`host_wall_ns=4953113`. This extends lifecycle evidence beyond the
graph-descriptor repeat-run path to generic indexed tensor/scalar descriptor
slots.

Graph-descriptor dependency inference now builds the producer map from the
whole descriptor before inferring omitted `dependents`, so the scene-test graph
adapter no longer requires topological task order. A focused unit test first
failed with `fanin=[0,0,0]` for a reordered graph where the final consumer is
task `0`; after the inference change it passed with `fanin=[2,0,0]`,
`dependents=[0,0]`, and dispatch sequence `[1,9,2]`. The corresponding
no-torch ctypes scene test passed locally on A100 with `2 passed, 50
deselected`, and passed on H200 with `1 passed, 51 deselected` after syncing
the working tree; the H200 command printed the known PTO-ISA SSH refresh
warning before passing.

The reordered graph descriptor was also captured through the paired persistent
smoke runner:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape graph_descriptor_reordered --task-count 3 \
    --queue-capacity 2 --repeat-runs 2 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_descriptor_reordered-repeat2-smoke-f877b7b3/`
contains `a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The validator required `runtime=persistent_device`,
`mode=dag`, `dag_shape=graph_descriptor_reordered`, `repeat_runs=2`,
`launch_completed_counts=[3,3]`, `dispatch_func_ids=[1,9,2]`, zero scheduler
errors, and generated report files. A100 reported per-launch device times
`[39936,23552]`, total `device_wall_ns=63488`, and `host_wall_ns=91185`.
H200 reported per-launch device times `[25632,20608]`, total
`device_wall_ns=46240`, and `host_wall_ns=63520`.

The diamond graph descriptor was then captured through the same paired smoke
runner:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python \
    .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_pair_persistent_smoke.py \
    --dag-shape graph_descriptor_diamond --task-count 5 \
    --queue-capacity 3 --repeat-runs 2 --sync-remote-tree
```

Result:
`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-graph_descriptor_diamond-repeat2-smoke-072e396c/`
contains `a100.json`, `h200.json`, `cuda-smoke-report.md`, and
`cuda-smoke-report.svg`. The validator required
`runtime=persistent_device`, `mode=dag`,
`dag_shape=graph_descriptor_diamond`, `repeat_runs=2`,
`launch_completed_counts=[5,5]`, `dispatch_func_ids=[9,2,1,2,1]`,
`graph_descriptor.fanin=[0,0,2,2,2]`,
`graph_descriptor.dependents=[2,3,2,3,4,4]`, zero scheduler errors, and
generated report files. A100 reported per-launch device times
`[49152,31744]`, total `device_wall_ns=80896`, and
`host_wall_ns=111293`. H200 reported per-launch device times
`[24096,23520]`, total `device_wall_ns=47616`, and
`host_wall_ns=4912047`.

Needed:

- broader CUDA scene-test argument builders beyond the current binary
  elementwise, unary square, scalar scale, axpy, affine, triad, quad,
  host-schedule generic-args, and persistent scalar/DAG tracer bullets.

### Fourth-Tensor Persistent DAG Verification

After adding the fourth tensor pointer to the persistent DAG descriptor, the
new quad DAG shape was verified with both Python coverage and real CUDA data.
The quad graph uses generated-dispatch `func_id` sequence `[8, 2, 1]`; the
first task computes `a * b + c * d`, and the final task adds an independent
`a * b` branch.

Focused local tests:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_persistent_codegen.py \
  tests/ut/py/test_cuda_benchmark_report.py \
  -q -m "not requires_hardware"

.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_scene_test.py \
  -q -k quad_with_ctypes --platform cuda

.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ut/py/test_cuda_backend.py \
  -q -k dispatch_dag_quad --platform cuda
```

Results: `148` non-hardware tests passed, the CUDA ctypes scene test passed,
and the CUDA standalone smoke test passed on the local A100.

The same standalone smoke was run on the remote H200 with a tree sync:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PWD/python \
  .venv/bin/python .agents/skills/cuda-backend-eval/scripts/cuda_persistent_smoke.py \
    --device 0 --task-count 3 --n 4096 --arch compute_90 \
    --mode dag --queue-capacity 2 --dag-shape quad \
    --output-json tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-quad-smoke-working/h200.json
```

Result artifacts:

- `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-quad-smoke-working/a100.json`
- `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-quad-smoke-working/h200.json`
- `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-quad-smoke-working/cuda-smoke-report.md`
- `tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-quad-smoke-working/cuda-smoke-report.svg`

Both A100 and H200 runs reported zero scheduler errors and tensor arguments
`c=tmp0,d=tmp3`.

### Target Role Cleanup

CUDA now builds native `host` and `device` target roles when a runtime build
config declares `device`, and runtime consumers can read binaries through
roles instead of direct hardware slot names. The current compatibility mapping
is:

- Ascend: `host`, `aicpu`, and `aicore` map to their existing artifacts.
- CUDA: `host` maps to `libhost_runtime.so`, `device` maps to
  `libcuda_device_runtime.so`, and legacy `aicpu_path` / `aicore_path`
  attributes alias the same CUDA device artifact.

The Python `ChipWorker.init(...)` wrapper now resolves runtime binary paths
through `path_for_role(...)` / `role_paths` first. A CUDA role-only binary map
with `host` and `device` can initialize through the Python API while the
underlying C++ nanobind call still receives its compatibility host,
scheduler, and device path arguments.

Needed:

- optional `scheduler` role once `persistent_device` has a separately named
  scheduler/runtime image;
- removal of legacy `aicpu_path` and `aicore_path` attributes after all
  external and C++ binding boundaries accept role-keyed binaries directly.

### Persistent Scheduler Generalization

The persistent-device scheduler is proven for small generated descriptors, but
it is not yet a full TensorMap/ringbuffer analogue.

Needed:

- graph construction from normal PTO task graphs;
- broader graph-lowering coverage beyond the current
  `persistent_dag_graph_f32` descriptor adapter, automatic default temporary
  allocation, order-independent tensor-flow dependency-inference mode, and
  five-task fan-out/fan-in graph descriptor smoke;
- broader lifecycle validation beyond the current scratch-reuse,
  graph-descriptor and generic-argument repeat-run, and direct/queue/DAG
  prepared-callable repeat-run smokes. The paired lifecycle matrix runner now
  captures direct, queue, and DAG-chain repeat-run evidence across A100 and
  H200 in one artifact set
  (`tmp/cuda-backend/persistent-lifecycle-matrix-d9082288/`), so the remaining
  lifecycle gap is normal PTO graph breadth rather than prepared-callable reset
  coverage;
- broader resource policy beyond the current single scheduler block,
  configurable queue/DAG worker blocks, direct worker-blocks-per-task, and
  callable stream id tracer bullet. The current paired A100/H200 resource
  policy smoke validates a five-task DAG-chain repeat run with
  `scheduler_blocks=1`, `worker_blocks=2`, `worker_blocks_per_task=1`,
  `stream_id=1`, `block_dim=256`, and `grid_dim=3`, so the remaining gap is
  policy breadth rather than artifact validation;
- broader scheduler error taxonomy beyond the current unsupported-`func_id`
  invalid-dependent-ID, dependent-range, fan-in-underflow, initial-fan-in, and
  no-root/unreachable-task diagnostics.

### Tuned Tensor Workloads

The tensor DAG row validates descriptor metadata and generated dispatch, but
the GEMM body is a scalar microbenchmark rather than a tuned tensor-core
kernel. The first paired tensor-shape sweep now covers `8x4x12`,
`16x16x64`, and `32x16x64` descriptors on A100 and H200. The first
`tensor_core_tile` smoke and selected-baseline benchmark row also validate a
block-wide WMMA generated-dispatch task body on both GPUs. The benchmark
report now includes a signed DAG-increment table and SVG, so scheduler-vs-task
work separation exists for current microbenchmarks. The remaining gap is
tuned tensor execution and comparative throughput, not descriptor-shape or
first tensor-core callable plumbing.

Needed:

- tensor-core or library-backed callable body tuning beyond the current
  single-tile WMMA benchmark row;
- broader model-kernel shape families once the tensor-core/library path
  exists;
- real tuned-kernel throughput rows beyond the current scheduler-adjusted
  microbenchmark deltas.

### CI Coverage

CUDA tests are optional and hardware-dependent. They currently provide strong
local evidence but are not guaranteed in every CI environment.

Needed:

- optional CUDA CI runner coverage if infrastructure becomes available.
