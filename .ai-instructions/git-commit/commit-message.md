# Commit Message Rules

1. Do not add co-author lines (e.g., `Co-Authored-By:`) to commits.
2. Use the format `Type: concise description` where Type is one of:
   - **Refactor** — restructuring without behavior change
   - **Fix** — bug fix
   - **Add** — new feature or file
   - **Update** — enhancement to existing feature
   - **Support** — tooling, profiling, CI infrastructure
   - **Sim** — simulation-specific changes
   - **CI** — CI/CD pipeline changes
3. Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
4. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add X" not "Added X").
